Question: What's the difference between DDR4 and DDR5 RAM?

Answer: DDR5 RAM offers higher speeds (up to 6400MHz+) compared to DDR4 (typically 2133-3200MHz). DDR5 also has improved power efficiency with lower voltage (1.1V vs 1.2V) and higher bandwidth. However, DDR5 typically has higher latency and is more expensive. For most gaming and everyday use, DDR4 is still excellent value.

Question: How much power supply wattage do I need for an RTX 4090?

Answer: NVIDIA recommends an 850W power supply for the RTX 4090, but many users opt for 1000W or higher for headroom and efficiency. The 4090 has a 450W TDP, so you need to account for your CPU (100-250W), motherboard, drives, and other components. A quality 1000W PSU from brands like Corsair, EVGA, or Seasonic is recommended.

Question: Is 16GB RAM enough for gaming in 2024?

Answer: 16GB RAM is still adequate for most gaming in 2024, but 32GB is becoming the recommended amount for new builds. Some modern games like Star Citizen, Cyberpunk 2077, and flight simulators can use more than 16GB. If you multitask (gaming while streaming/browsing), 32GB provides much better headroom. DDR4 16GB kits are affordable, making 32GB a good value upgrade.

Question: What CPU should I pair with an RTX 4070?

Answer: For an RTX 4070, good CPU pairings include: Intel Core i5-13600K or i5-14600K for excellent gaming performance, AMD Ryzen 5 7600X or 7700X for great value, or Intel Core i7-13700K/i7-14700K if you also do productivity work. Avoid pairing with older CPUs like the i5-10400 or Ryzen 3600 as they may bottleneck the GPU in CPU-intensive games at 1080p.

Question: Do I need a CPU cooler or can I use the stock one?

Answer: Intel K-series CPUs and AMD Ryzen 5 7600X and above don't include stock coolers. Intel non-K chips include basic coolers that work but are loud under load. AMD's stock coolers (Wraith) are better but still noisy. For best results, invest in a tower cooler like the Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 ($35) or Arctic Freezer 34 eSports. High-end CPUs benefit from 280mm+ AIOs.

Article: Graphics processing unit

Agraphics processing unit(GPU) is a specializedelectronic circuitdesigned fordigital image processingand to acceleratecomputer graphics, being present either as a component on a discretegraphics cardor embedded onmotherboards,mobile phones,personal computers,workstations, andgame consoles.  GPUs are increasingly being used for AI processing due to linear algebra acceleration which is also used extensively in graphics processing.

Although there is no single definition of the term, and it may be used to describe any video display system, in modern use a GPU includes the ability to internally perform the calculations needed for various graphics tasks, like rotating and scaling 3D images, and often the additional ability to run custom programs known asshaders. This contrasts with earlier graphics controllers known asvideo display controllerswhich had no internal calculation capabilities, orblitters, which performed only basic memory movement operations. The modern GPU emerged during the 1990s, adding the ability to perform operations like drawing lines and text without CPU help, and later adding 3D functionality.

Graphics functions are generally independent and this lends these tasks to being implemented on separate calculation engines. Modern GPUs include hundreds, or thousands, of calculation units. This made them useful for non-graphic calculations involvingembarrassingly parallelproblems due to theirparallel structure. The ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to their adoption in diverse fields includingartificial intelligence(AI) where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training ofneural networksandcryptocurrency mining.

Arcade system boardshave used specialized graphics circuits since the 1970s. In early video game hardware,RAMfor frame buffers was expensive, so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor.[1]

A specializedbarrel shiftercircuit helped the CPU animate theframebuffergraphics for various 1970sarcade video gamesfromMidwayandTaito, such asGun Fight(1975),Sea Wolf(1976), andSpace Invaders(1978).[2]TheNamco Galaxianarcade system in 1979 used specializedgraphics hardwarethat supportedRGB color, multi-colored sprites, andtilemapbackgrounds.[3]The Galaxian hardware was widely used during thegolden age of arcade video games, by game companies such asNamco,Centuri,Gremlin,Irem,Konami, Midway,Nichibutsu,Sega, andTaito.[4]

TheAtari 2600in 1977 used a video shifter called theTelevision Interface Adaptor.[5]Atari 8-bit computers(1979) hadANTIC, a video processor which interpreted instructions describing a "display list"—the way the scan lines map to specificbitmappedor character modes and where the memory is stored (so there did not need to be a contiguous frame buffer).[clarification needed][6]6502machine codesubroutinescould be triggered onscan linesby setting a bit on a display list instruction.[clarification needed][7]ANTIC also supported smoothverticalandhorizontal scrollingindependent of the CPU.[8]

TheNEC μPD7220was the first implementation of apersonal computergraphics display processor as a singlelarge-scale integration(LSI)integrated circuitchip. This enabled the design of low-cost, high-performance video graphics cards such as those fromNumber Nine Visual Technology. It became the best-known GPU until the mid-1980s.[9]It was the first fully integratedVLSI(very large-scale integration)metal–oxide–semiconductor(NMOS) graphics display processor for PCs, supported up to1024×1024 resolution, and laid the foundations for the PC graphics market. It was used in a number of graphics cards and was licensed for clones such as the Intel 82720, the first ofIntel's graphics processing units.[10]TheWilliams Electronicsarcade gamesRobotron: 2084,Joust,Sinistar, andBubbles, all released in 1982, contain customblitterchips for operating on 16-color bitmaps.[11][12]

In 1984,Hitachireleased the ARTC HD63484, the first majorCMOSgraphics processor for personal computers. The ARTC could display up to4K resolutionwhen inmonochromemode. It was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late 1980s.[13]In 1985, theAmigawas released with a custom graphics chip including a blitter for bitmap manipulation, line drawing, and area fill. It also included acoprocessorwith its own simple instruction set, that was capable of manipulating graphics hardware registers in sync with the video beam (e.g. for per-scanline palette switches,sprite multiplexing, and hardware windowing), or driving the blitter. In 1986,Texas Instrumentsreleased theTMS34010, the first fully programmable graphics processor.[14]It could run general-purpose code but also had a graphics-oriented instruction set. During 1990–1992, this chip became the basis of theTexas Instruments Graphics Architecture("TIGA")Windows acceleratorcards.

In 1987, theIBM 8514graphics system was released. It was one of the first video cards forIBM PC compatiblesthat implementedfixed-function2D primitives inelectronic hardware.Sharp'sX68000, released in 1987, used a custom graphics chipset[15]with a 65,536 color palette and hardware support for sprites, scrolling, and multiple playfields.[16]It served as a development machine forCapcom'sCP Systemarcade board. Fujitsu'sFM Townscomputer, released in 1989, had support for a 16,777,216 color palette.[17]In 1988, the first dedicatedpolygonal 3Dgraphics boards were introduced in arcades with theNamco System 21[18]andTaitoAir System.[19]

IBMintroduced itsproprietaryVideo Graphics Array(VGA) display standard in 1987, with a maximum resolution of 640×480 pixels. In November 1988,NEC Home Electronicsannounced its creation of theVideo Electronics Standards Association(VESA) to develop and promote aSuper VGA(SVGA)computer display standardas a successor to VGA. Super VGA enabledgraphics display resolutionsup to 800×600pixels, a 56% increase.[20]

In 1991,S3 Graphicsintroduced theS3 86C911, which its designers named after thePorsche 911as an indication of the performance increase it promised.[21]The 86C911 spawned a variety of imitators: by 1995, all major PC graphics chip makers had added2Dacceleration support to their chips.[22]Fixed-functionWindows acceleratorssurpassed expensive general-purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance, and such coprocessors faded from the PC market.

In the early- and mid-1990s,real-time3D graphics became increasingly common in arcade, computer, and console games, which led to increasing public demand for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. Early examples of mass-market 3D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as theSega Model 1,Namco System 22, andSega Model 2, and thefifth-generation video game consolessuch as theSaturn,PlayStation, andNintendo 64. Arcade systems such as the Sega Model 2 andSGIOnyx-based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in 1993 were capable of hardware T&L (transform, clipping, and lighting) years before appearing in consumer graphics cards.[23][24]Another early example is theSuper FXchip, aRISC-basedon-cartridge graphics chipused in someSNESgames, notablyDoomandStar Fox. Some systems usedDSPsto accelerate transformations.Fujitsu, which worked on the Sega Model 2 arcade system,[25]began working on integrating T&L into a singleLSIsolution for use in home computers in 1995;[26]the Fujitsu Pinolite, the first 3D geometry processor for personal computers, announced in 1997.[27]The first hardware T&L GPU onhomevideo game consoleswas theNintendo 64'sReality Coprocessor, released in 1996.[28]In 1997,Mitsubishireleased the3Dpro/2MP, a GPU capable of transformation and lighting, forworkstationsandWindows NTdesktops;[29]ATiused it for itsFireGL 4000graphics card, released in 1997.[30]

The term "GPU" was coined bySonyin reference to the 32-bitSony GPU(designed byToshiba) in thePlayStationvideo game console, released in 1994.[31]

In October 2002, with the introduction of theATIRadeon 9700(also known as R300), the world's firstDirect3D9.0 accelerator, pixel and vertexshaderscould implementloopingand lengthyfloating pointmath, and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs, yet orders of magnitude faster for image-array operations. Pixel shading is often used forbump mapping, which adds texture to make an object look shiny, dull, rough, or even round or extruded.[32]

With the introduction of the NvidiaGeForce 8 seriesand new generic stream processing units, GPUs became more generalized computing devices.ParallelGPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU computing orGPGPUforgeneral purpose computing on GPU, has found applications in fields as diverse asmachine learning,[33]oil exploration, scientificimage processing,linear algebra,[34]statistics,[35]3D reconstruction, andstock optionspricing. GPGPUs were the precursors to what is now called a compute shader (e.g.CUDA,OpenCL,DirectCompute) and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader.[clarification needed]This entails some overheads since units like thescan converterare involved where they are not needed (nor are triangle manipulations even a concern—except to invoke the pixel shader).[clarification needed]

Nvidia's CUDA platform, first introduced in 2007,[36]was the earliest widely adopted programming model for GPU computing. OpenCL is an open standard defined by theKhronos Groupthat allows for the development of code for both GPUs and CPUs with an emphasis on portability.[37]OpenCL solutions are supported by Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM, and according to a report in 2011 byEvans Data, OpenCL had become the second most popular HPC tool.[38]

In 2010, Nvidia partnered withAudito power their cars' dashboards, using theTegraGPU to provide increased functionality to cars' navigation and entertainment systems.[39]Advances in GPU technology in cars helped advanceself-driving technology.[40]AMD'sRadeon HD 6000 seriescards were released in 2010, and in 2011 AMD released its 6000M Series discrete GPUs for mobile devices.[41]TheKepler lineof graphics cards by Nvidia were released in 2012 and were used in the Nvidia 600 and 700 series cards. A feature in this GPU microarchitecture included GPU boost, a technology that adjusts the clock-speed of a video card to increase or decrease according to its power draw.[42]Kepler also introducedNVENCvideo encoding acceleration technology.

ThePS4andXbox Onewere released in 2013; they both used GPUs based onAMD's Radeon HD 7850 and 7790.[43]Nvidia's Kepler line of GPUs was followed by theMaxwellline, manufactured on the same process. Nvidia's 28 nm chips were manufactured byTSMCin Taiwan using the 28 nm process. Compared to the 40 nm technology from the past, this manufacturing process allowed a 20 percent boost in performance while drawing less power.[44][45]Virtual reality headsetshave high system requirements; manufacturers recommended the GTX 970 and the R9 290X or better at the time of their release.[46][47]Cards based on thePascalmicroarchitecture were released in 2016. TheGeForce 10 seriesof cards are of this generation of graphics cards. They are made using the 16 nm manufacturing process which improves upon previous microarchitectures.[48]

In 2018, Nvidia launched the RTX 20 series GPUs that addedray tracingcores to GPUs, improving their performance on lighting effects.[49]Polaris 11andPolaris 10GPUs from AMD are fabricated by a 14 nm process. Their release resulted in a substantial increase in the performance per watt of AMD video cards.[50]AMD also released the Vega GPU series for the high end market as a competitor to Nvidia's high end Pascal cards, also featuringHBM2like the Titan V.

In 2019, AMD released the successor to theirGraphics Core Next(GCN) microarchitecture/instruction set. DubbedRDNA, the first product featuring it was theRadeon RX 5000 seriesof video cards.[51]The company announced that the successor to the RDNA microarchitecture would be incremental (a "refresh"). AMD unveiled theRadeon RX 6000 series, itsRDNA 2graphics cards with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing.[52]The product series, launched in late 2020, consisted of the RX 6800, RX 6800 XT, and RX 6900 XT.[53][54]The RX 6700 XT, which is based on Navi 22, was launched in early 2021.[55]

ThePlayStation 5andXbox Series X and Series Swere released in 2020; they both use GPUs based on the RDNA 2 microarchitecture with incremental improvements and different GPU configurations in each system's implementation.[56][57][58]

In the 2020s, GPUs have been increasingly used for calculations involvingembarrassingly parallelproblems, such as training ofneural networkson enormous datasets that are needed for artificial intelligencelarge language models. Specialized processing cores on some modern workstation's GPUs are dedicated fordeep learningsince they have significantFLOPSperformance increases, using 4×4 matrix multiplication and division, resulting in hardware performance up to 128 TFLOPS in some applications.[59]These tensor cores are expected to appear in consumer cards, as well.[needs update][60]

Many companies have produced GPUs under a number of brand names. In 2009,[needs update]Intel,Nvidia, andAMD/ATIwere the market share leaders, with 49.4%, 27.8%, and 20.6% market share respectively. In addition,Matrox[61]produces GPUs. Chinese companies such asJingjia Microhave also produced GPUs for the domestic market although in terms of worldwide sales, they lag behind market leaders.[62]

Several factors of GPU construction affect the performance of the card for real-time rendering, such as the size of the connector pathways in thesemiconductor device fabrication, theclock signalfrequency, and the number and size of various on-chip memorycaches. Performance is also affected by the number of streaming multiprocessors (SM) for NVidia GPUs, or compute units (CU) for AMD GPUs, or Xe cores for Intel discrete GPUs, which describe the number of on-silicon processor core units within the GPU chip that perform the core calculations, typically working in parallel with other SM/CUs on the GPU. GPU performance is typically measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS); GPUs in the 2010s and 2020s typically deliver performance measured in teraflops (TFLOPS). This is an estimated performance measure, as other factors can affect the actual display rate.[63]

An earlier GPU may support one or more 2D graphics APIs for 2D acceleration, such asGDIandDirectDraw.[64]

In the 1970s, the term "GPU" originally stood forgraphics processor unitand described a programmable processing unit working independently from the CPU that was responsible for graphics manipulation and output.[65][66]In 1994,Sonyused the term (now standing forgraphics processing unit) in reference to thePlayStationconsole'sToshiba-designedSony GPU.[31]The term was popularized byNvidiain 1999, who marketed theGeForce 256as "the world's first GPU".[67]It was presented as a "single-chipprocessorwith integratedtransform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines".[68]RivalATI Technologiescoined the term "visual processing unit" orVPUwith the release of theRadeon 9700in 2002.[69]TheAMD Alveo MA35Dfeatures dual VPU’s, each using the5 nm processin 2023.[70]

Dedicated graphics processing unitsuseRAMthat is dedicated to the GPU rather than relying on the computer’s main system memory. This RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the graphics card (seeGDDR). Sometimes systems with dedicateddiscreteGPUs were called "DIS" systems as opposed to "UMA" systems (see next section).[72]

Technologies such asScan-Line Interleaveby 3dfx,SLIandNVLinkby Nvidia andCrossFireby AMD allow multiple GPUs to draw images simultaneously for a single screen, increasing the processing power available for graphics. These technologies, however, are increasingly uncommon; most games do not fully use multiple GPUs, as most users cannot afford them.[73][74][75]Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers (like inSummit), on workstations to accelerate video (processing multiple videos at once)[76][77][78]and 3D rendering,[79]forVFX,[80]GPGPUworkloads and for simulations,[81]and in AI to expedite training, as is the case with Nvidia's lineup of DGX workstations and servers, Tesla GPUs, and Intel's Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

Integrated graphics processing units(IGPU),integrated graphics,shared graphics solutions,integrated graphics processors(IGP), orunified memory architectures(UMA) use a portion of a computer's system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory. IGPs can be integrated onto a motherboard as part of itsnorthbridgechipset,[82]or on the samedie (integrated circuit)with the CPU (likeAMD APUorIntel HD Graphics). On certain motherboards,[83]AMD's IGPs can use dedicated sideport memory: a separate fixed block of high performance memory that is dedicated for use by the GPU. As of early 2007[update], computers with integrated graphics account for about 90% of all PC shipments.[84][needs update]They are less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing, but tend to be less capable. Historically, integrated processing was considered unfit for 3D games or graphically intensive programs but could run less intensive programs such as Adobe Flash. Examples of such IGPs would be offerings from SiS and VIA circa 2004.[85]However, modern integrated graphics processors such asAMD Accelerated Processing UnitandIntel Graphics Technology(HD, UHD, Iris, Iris Pro, Iris Plus, andXe-LP) can handle 2D graphics or low-stress 3D graphics.

Since GPU computations are memory-intensive, integrated processing may compete with the CPU for relatively slow system RAM, as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory. IGPs use system memory with bandwidth up to a current maximum of 128 GB/s, whereas a discrete graphics card may have a bandwidth[86]of more than 1000 GB/s between itsVRAMand GPU core. Thismemory busbandwidth can limit the performance of the GPU, thoughmulti-channel memorycan mitigate this deficiency.[87]Older integrated graphics chipsets lacked hardwaretransform and lighting, but newer ones include it.[88][89]

On systems with "Unified Memory Architecture" (UMA), including modern AMD processors with integrated graphics,[90]modern Intel processors with integrated graphics,[91]Apple processors, the PS5 and Xbox Series (among others), the CPU cores and the GPU block share the same pool of RAM and memory address space.

It is common to use ageneral purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)as a modified form ofstream processor(or avector processor), runningcompute kernels. This turns the massive computational power of a modern graphics accelerator's shader pipeline into general-purpose computing power. In certain applications requiring massive vector operations, this can yield several orders of magnitude higher performance than a conventional CPU. The two largest discrete (see "Dedicated graphics processing unit" above) GPU designers,AMDandNvidia, are pursuing this approach with an array of applications. Both Nvidia and AMD teamed withStanford Universityto create a GPU-based client for theFolding@homedistributed computing project for protein folding calculations. In certain circumstances, the GPU calculates forty times faster than the CPUs traditionally used by such applications.[92][93]

GPU-based high performance computers play a significant role in large-scale modelling. Three of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world take advantage of GPU acceleration.[94]

Since 2005 there has been interest in using the performance offered by GPUs forevolutionary computationin general, and for accelerating thefitnessevaluation ingenetic programmingin particular. Most approaches compilelinearortree programson the host PC and transfer the executable to the GPU to be run. Typically a performance advantage is only obtained by running the single active program simultaneously on many example problems in parallel, using the GPU'sSIMDarchitecture.[95]However, substantial acceleration can also be obtained by not compiling the programs, and instead transferring them to the GPU, to be interpreted there.[96]

Therefore, it is desirable to attach a GPU to some external bus of a notebook.PCI Expressis the only bus used for this purpose. The port may be, for example, anExpressCardormPCIeport (PCIe ×1, up to 5 or 2.5 Gbit/s respectively), aThunderbolt1, 2, or 3 port (PCIe ×4, up to 10, 20, or 40 Gbit/s respectively), aUSB4 port with Thunderbolt compatibility, or anOCuLinkport. Those ports are only available on certain notebook systems.[97]eGPU enclosures include their own power supply (PSU), because powerful GPUs can consume hundreds of watts.[98]

Graphics processing units (GPU) have continued to increase in energy usage, while CPUs designers have recently[when?]focused on improving performance per watt. High performance GPUs may draw large amount of power, therefore intelligent techniques are required to manage GPU power consumption. Measures like3DMark2006 scoreper watt can help identify more efficient GPUs.[99]However that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use, where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks.[100]

With modern GPUs, energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved. GPU designs are usually highly scalable, allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card, or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel. Peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate. Consequently, performance per watt of a GPU design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design.

In 2013, 438.3 million GPUs were shipped globally and the forecast for 2014 was 414.2 million. However, by the third quarter of 2022, shipments of PC GPUs totaled around 75.5 million units, down 19% year-over-year.[101][needs update][102]

Article: Central processing unit

Acentral processing unit(CPU), also called acentral processor,main processor, or justprocessor, is the primaryprocessorin a givencomputer.[1][2]Itselectronic circuitryexecutesinstructionsof acomputer program, such asarithmetic, logic, controlling, andinput/output(I/O) operations.[3][4][5]This role contrasts with that of external components, such asmain memoryand I/O circuitry,[6]and specializedcoprocessorssuch asgraphics processing units(GPUs).

The form,design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.[7]Principal components of a CPU include thearithmetic–logic unit(ALU) that performsarithmeticandlogic operations,processor registersthat supplyoperandsto the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and acontrol unitthat orchestrates thefetching (from memory),decodingandexecution (of instructions)by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and other components. Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor area tocachesandinstruction-level parallelismto increase performance and toCPU modesto supportoperating systemsandvirtualization.

Most modern CPUs are implemented onintegrated circuitmicroprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are calledmulti-core processors(MCP).[8]The individual physical CPUs, calledprocessor cores, can also bemultithreadedto support CPU-level multithreading.[9]

An IC that contains a CPU may also containmemory,peripheralinterfaces, and other components of a computer;[10]such integrated devices are variously calledmicrocontrollersorsystems on a chip(SoC).

Early computers such as theENIAChad to be physically rewired to perform different tasks, which caused these machines to be called "fixed-program computers".[11]The "central processing unit" term has been in use since as early as 1955.[12][13]Since the term "CPU" is generally defined as a device forsoftware(computer program) execution, the earliest devices that could rightly be called CPUs came with the advent of thestored-program computer.

The idea of a stored-program computer had already been present in the design ofJohn Presper EckertandJohn William Mauchly'sENIAC, but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner.[14]On June 30, 1945, before ENIAC was made, mathematicianJohn von Neumanndistributed a paper entitledFirst Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. It was the outline of a stored-program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949.[15]EDVACwas designed to perform a certain number of instructions (or operations) of various types. Significantly, the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high-speedcomputer memoryrather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer.[16]This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC, which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task.[17]With von Neumann's design, the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory. EDVAC was not the first stored-program computer; theManchester Baby, which was a small-scale experimental stored-program computer, ran its first program on 21 June 1948[18]and theManchester Mark 1ran its first program during the night of 16–17 June 1949.[19]

Early CPUs were custom designs used as part of a larger and sometimes distinctive computer.[20]However, this method of designing custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of multi-purpose processors produced in large quantities. This standardization began in the era of discretetransistormainframesandminicomputers, and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of theintegrated circuit(IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order ofnanometers.[21]Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in electronic devices ranging from automobiles[22]to cellphones,[23]and sometimes even in toys.[24][25]

While von Neumann is most often credited with the design of the stored-program computer because of his design of EDVAC, and the design became known as thevon Neumann architecture, others before him, such asKonrad Zuse, had suggested and implemented similar ideas.[26]The so-calledHarvard architectureof theHarvard Mark I, which was completed before EDVAC,[27][28]also used a stored-program design usingpunched paper taperather than electronic memory.[29]The key difference between the two is that Harvard architecture separates the storage and treatment of CPU instructions and data, whereas von Neumann architecture uses the same memory space for both.[30]Most modern CPUs are primarily von Neumann in design, but CPUs with the Harvard architecture are seen as well, especially in embedded applications; for instance, theAtmel AVRmicrocontrollers are Harvard-architecture processors.[31]

Prior to the invention of the transistor,relaysandvacuum tubes(thermionic tubes) were commonly used as switching elements;[32][33]a useful computer requires thousands or tens of thousands of switching devices. The overall speed of a system is dependent on the speed of the switches.Vacuum-tube computerssuch as EDVAC tended to average eight hours between failures, whereas relay computers—such as the slower but earlierHarvard Mark I—failed very rarely.[13]In the end, tube-based CPUs became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded generally outweighed the reliability problems. Most of these early synchronous CPUs ran at lowclock ratescompared to modern microelectronic designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100kHzto 4 MHz were very common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with.[34]

The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated the building of smaller and more reliable electronic devices. The first such improvement came with the advent of thetransistor. Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky, unreliable, and fragile switching elements, likevacuum tubesandrelays.[35]With this improvement, more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or severalprinted circuit boardscontaining discrete (individual) components.

In 1964,IBMintroduced itsIBM System/360computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speeds and performances.[36]This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate this improvement, IBM used the concept of amicroprogram(often called "microcode"), which still sees widespread use in modern CPUs.[37]The System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated themainframe computermarket for decades and left a legacy that is continued by similar modern computers like the IBMzSeries.[38][39]In 1965,Digital Equipment Corporation(DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets—thePDP-8.[40]

Transistor-based computers had several distinct advantages over their predecessors. Aside from facilitating increased reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a transistor in comparison to a tube or relay.[41]The increased reliability and dramatically increased speed of the switching elements, which were almost exclusively transistors by this time; CPU clock rates in the tens of megahertz were easily obtained during this period.[42]Additionally, while discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance designs likesingle instruction, multiple data(SIMD)vector processorsbegan to appear.[43]These early experimental designs later gave rise to the era of specializedsupercomputerslike those made byCray IncandFujitsu Ltd.[43]

During this period, a method of manufacturing many interconnected transistors in a compact space was developed. Theintegrated circuit(IC) allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a singlesemiconductor-baseddie, or "chip". At first, only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such asNOR gateswere miniaturized into ICs.[44]CPUs based on these "building block" ICs are generally referred to as "small-scale integration" (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, such as the ones used in theApollo Guidance Computer, usually contained up to a few dozen transistors. To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than earlier discrete transistor designs.[45]

IBM'sSystem/370, follow-on to the System/360, used SSI ICs rather thanSolid Logic Technologydiscrete-transistor modules.[46][47]DEC'sPDP-8/I and KI10PDP-10also switched from the individual transistors used by the PDP-8 and KA PDP-10 to SSI ICs,[48]and their extremely popularPDP-11line was originally built with SSI ICs, but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became practical.

Lee Boyselpublished influential articles, including a 1967 "manifesto", which described how to build the equivalent of a 32-bit mainframe computer from a relatively small number oflarge-scale integrationcircuits (LSI).[49][50]The only way to build LSI chips, which are chips with a hundred or more gates, was to build them using ametal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS)semiconductor manufacturing process(eitherPMOS logic,NMOS logic, orCMOSlogic). However, some companies continued to build processors out of bipolartransistor–transistor logic(TTL) chips because bipolar junction transistors were faster than MOS chips up until the 1970s (a few companies such asDatapointcontinued to build processors out of TTL chips until the early 1980s).[50]In the 1960s, MOS ICs were slower and initially considered useful only in applications that required low power.[51][52]Following the development ofsilicon-gateMOS technology byFederico Fagginat Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, MOS ICs largely replaced bipolar TTL as the standard chip technology in the late 1970s.[53]

As themicroelectronictechnology advanced, an increasing number of transistors were placed on ICs, decreasing the number of individual ICs needed for a complete CPU. MSI and LSI ICs increased transistor counts to hundreds, and then thousands. By 1968, the number of ICs required to build a complete CPU had been reduced to 24 ICs of eight different types, with each IC containing roughly 1000 MOSFETs.[54]In stark contrast with its SSI and MSI predecessors, the first LSI implementation of the PDP-11 contained a CPU composed of only four LSI integrated circuits.[55]

Since microprocessors were first introduced they have almost completely overtaken all other central processing unit implementation methods. The first commercially available microprocessor, made in 1971, was theIntel 4004. The Intel 4004 was one of the first consumer-facing CPUs integratingarithmetic logic unit,control unit, andregister uniton a chip.[56]The first widely used microprocessor, made in 1974, was theIntel 8080. Mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers of the time launched proprietary IC development programs to upgrade their oldercomputer architectures, and eventually producedinstruction setcompatible microprocessors that were backward-compatible with their older hardware and software. Combined with the advent and eventual success of the ubiquitouspersonal computer, the termCPUis now applied almost exclusively[a]to microprocessors. Several CPUs (denotedcores) can be combined in a single processing chip.[57]

Previous generations of CPUs were implemented asdiscrete componentsand numerous smallintegrated circuits(ICs) on one or more circuit boards.[58]Microprocessors, on the other hand, are CPUs manufactured on a very small number of ICs; usually just one.[59]The overall smaller CPU size, as a result of being implemented on a single die, means faster switching time because of physical factors like decreased gateparasitic capacitance.[60][61]This has allowed synchronous microprocessors to have clock rates ranging from tens of megahertz to several gigahertz. Additionally, the ability to construct exceedingly small transistors on an IC has increased the complexity and number of transistors in a single CPU many fold. This widely observed trend is described byMoore's law, which had proven to be a fairly accurate predictor of the growth of CPU (and other IC) complexity until 2016.[62][63]

While the complexity, size, construction and general form of CPUs have changed enormously since 1950,[64]the basic design and function has not changed much at all. Almost all common CPUs today can be very accurately described as von Neumann stored-program machines.[65][b]As Moore's law no longer holds, concerns have arisen about the limits of integrated circuit transistor technology. Extreme miniaturization ofelectronic gatesis causing the effects of phenomena likeelectromigrationandsubthreshold leakageto become much more significant.[67][68]These newer concerns are among the many factors causing researchers to investigate new methods of computing such as thequantum computer, as well as to expand the use ofparallelismand other methods that extend the usefulness of the classical von Neumann model.

The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a sequence of storedinstructionsthat is called a program. The instructions to be executed are kept in some kind ofcomputer memory. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as theinstruction cycle.

After the execution of an instruction, the entire process repeats, with the next instruction cycle normally fetching the next-in-sequence instruction because of the incremented value in theprogram counter. If a jump instruction was executed, the program counter will be modified to contain the address of the instruction that was jumped to and program execution continues normally. In more complex CPUs, multiple instructions can be fetched, decoded and executed simultaneously. This section describes what is generally referred to as the "classic RISC pipeline", which is quite common among the simple CPUs used in many electronic devices (often called microcontrollers). It largely ignores the important role of CPU cache, and therefore the access stage of the pipeline.

Some instructions manipulate the program counter rather than producing result data directly; such instructions are generally called "jumps" and facilitate program behavior likeloops, conditional program execution (through the use of a conditional jump), and existence offunctions.[c]In some processors, some other instructions change the state of bits in a"flags" register. These flags can be used to influence how a program behaves, since they often indicate the outcome of various operations. For example, in such processors a "compare" instruction evaluates two values and sets or clears bits in the flags register to indicate which one is greater or whether they are equal; one of these flags could then be used by a later jump instruction to determine program flow.

Fetch involves retrieving aninstruction(which is represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from program memory. The instruction's location (address) in program memory is determined by theprogram counter(PC; called the "instruction pointer" inIntel x86 microprocessors), which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be fetched. After an instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in the sequence.[d]Often, the instruction to be fetched must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to be returned. This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures (see below).

The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU will do. In the decode step, performed bybinary decodercircuitry known as theinstruction decoder, the instruction is converted into signals that control other parts of the CPU.

The way in which the instruction is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA).[e]Often, one group of bits (that is, a "field") within the instruction, called theopcode, indicates which operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be aprocessor registeror a memory address, as determined by someaddressing mode.

In some CPU designs, the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable binary decoder circuit. In others, amicroprogramis used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.

After the fetch and decode steps, the execute step is performed. Depending on the CPU architecture, this may consist of a single action or a sequence of actions. During each action, control signals electrically enable or disable various parts of the CPU so they can perform all or part of the desired operation. The action is then completed, typically in response to a clock pulse. Very often the results are written to an internal CPU register for quick access by subsequent instructions. In other cases results may be written to slower, but less expensive and higher capacitymain memory.

For example, if an instruction that performs addition is to be executed, registers containing operands (numbers to be summed) are activated, as are the parts of thearithmetic logic unit(ALU) that perform addition. When the clock pulse occurs, the operands flow from the source registers into the ALU, and the sum appears at its output. On subsequent clock pulses, other components are enabled (and disabled) to move the output (the sum of the operation) to storage (e.g., a register or memory). If the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), an arithmetic overflow flag will be set, influencing the next operation.

Hardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can perform, called aninstruction set. Such operations may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a different part of a program. Each instruction is represented by a unique combination ofbits, known as the machine languageopcode. While processing an instruction, the CPU decodes the opcode (via abinary decoder) into control signals, which orchestrate the behavior of the CPU. A complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and, in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation (for example, the numbers to be summed in the case of an addition operation). Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program is a collection of machine language instructions that the CPU executes.

The actual mathematical operation for each instruction is performed by acombinational logiccircuit within the CPU's processor known as thearithmetic–logic unitor ALU. In general, a CPU executes an instruction by fetching it from memory, using its ALU to perform an operation, and then storing the result to memory. Besides the instructions for integer mathematics and logic operations, various other machine instructions exist, such as those for loading data from memory and storing it back, branching operations, and mathematical operations on floating-point numbers performed by the CPU'sfloating-point unit(FPU).[69]

The control unit (CU) is a component of the CPU that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic and logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.

It directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals. Most computer resources are managed by the CU. It directs the flow of data between the CPU and the other devices.John von Neumannincluded the control unit as part of thevon Neumann architecture. In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the CPU with its overall role and operation unchanged since its introduction.[70]

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit within the processor that performs integer arithmetic andbitwise logicoperations. The inputs to the ALU are the data words to be operated on (calledoperands), status information from previous operations, and a code from the control unit indicating which operation to perform. Depending on the instruction being executed, the operands may come frominternal CPU registers, external memory, or constants generated by the ALU itself.

When all input signals have settled and propagated through the ALU circuitry, the result of the performed operation appears at the ALU's outputs. The result consists of both a data word, which may be stored in a register or memory, and status information that is typically stored in a special, internal CPU register reserved for this purpose.

The address generation unit (AGU), sometimes also called the address computation unit (ACU),[71]is anexecution unitinside the CPU that calculatesaddressesused by the CPU to accessmain memory. By having address calculations handled by separate circuitry that operates in parallel with the rest of the CPU, the number ofCPU cyclesrequired for executing variousmachine instructionscan be reduced, bringing performance improvements.

While performing various operations, CPUs need to calculate memory addresses required for fetching data from the memory; for example, in-memory positions ofarray elementsmust be calculated before the CPU can fetch the data from actual memory locations. Those address-generation calculations involve differentinteger arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction,modulo operations, orbit shifts. Often, calculating a memory address involves more than one general-purpose machine instruction, which do not necessarilydecode and executequickly. By incorporating an AGU into a CPU design, together with introducing specialized instructions that use the AGU, various address-generation calculations can be offloaded from the rest of the CPU, and can often be executed quickly in a single CPU cycle.

Capabilities of an AGU depend on a particular CPU and itsarchitecture. Thus, some AGUs implement and expose more address-calculation operations, while some also include more advanced specialized instructions that can operate on multipleoperandsat a time. Some CPU architectures include multiple AGUs so more than one address-calculation operation can be executed simultaneously, which brings further performance improvements due to thesuperscalarnature of advanced CPU designs. For example,Intelincorporates multiple AGUs into itsSandy BridgeandHaswellmicroarchitectures, which increase bandwidth of the CPU memory subsystem by allowing multiple memory-access instructions to be executed in parallel.

Many microprocessors (in smartphones and desktop, laptop, server computers) have a memory management unit (MMU), translating logical addresses into physical RAM addresses, providingmemory protectionandpagingabilities, useful forvirtual memory. The MMU is usually integrated in the processor but in some cases it is in a separate integrated circuit (IC).[72]Simpler processors, especiallymicrocontrollers, usually do not include an MMU.

ACPU cacheis a memory used by the central processing unit (CPU) of acomputerto reduce the average cost (time or energy) to accessdatafrom themain memory.[73]A cache is a smaller, faster memory, closer to aprocessor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used mainmemory locations. Most CPUs have different independent caches, usually organized as a hierarchy of several cache levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, etc.). Each ascending cache level is typically slower but larger than the preceding level with L1 being the fastest and the closest to the CPU. At the L1 level there are usually separateinstructionanddata caches.

Most modern (fast) CPUs (with few specialized exceptions[f]) have multiple levels of CPU caches. The first CPUs that used a cache had only one level of cache; unlike later level 1 caches, it was not split into L1d (for data) and L1i (for instructions). Almost all current CPUs with caches have a split L1 cache. They also have L2 caches and, for larger processors, L3 caches as well. The L2 cache is usually not split and acts as a common repository for the already split L1 cache. Every core of amulti-core processorhas a dedicated L2 cache and is usually not shared between the cores. The L3 cache, and higher-level caches, are shared between the cores and are not split. An L4 cache is currently uncommon, and is generally ondynamic random-access memory(DRAM), rather than onstatic random-access memory(SRAM), on a separate die or chip. That was also the case historically with L1, while bigger chips have allowed integration of it and generally all cache levels, with the possible exception of the last level. Each extra level of cache tends to be bigger and is optimized differently.

Other types of caches exist (that are not counted towards the "cache size" of the most important caches mentioned above), such as thetranslation lookaside buffer(TLB) that is part of thememory management unit(MMU) that most CPUs have.

Caches are generally sized in powers of two: 2, 8, 16 etc.KiBorMiB(for larger non-L1) sizes, although theIBM z13has a 96 KiB L1 instruction cache.[74]

Most CPUs aresynchronous circuits, which means they employ aclock signalto pace their sequential operations. The clock signal is produced by an externaloscillator circuitthat generates a consistent number of pulses each second in the form of a periodicsquare wave. The frequency of the clock pulses determines the rate at which a CPU executes instructions and, consequently, the faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU will execute each second.

To ensure proper operation of the CPU, the clock period is longer than the maximum time needed for all signals to propagate (move) through the CPU. In setting the clock period to a value well above the worst-casepropagation delay, it is possible to design the entire CPU and the way it moves data around the "edges" of the rising and falling clock signal. This has the advantage of simplifying the CPU significantly, both from a design perspective and a component-count perspective. However, it also carries the disadvantage that the entire CPU must wait on its slowest elements, even though some portions of it are much faster. This limitation has largely been compensated for by various methods of increasing CPU parallelism (see below).

However, architectural improvements alone do not solve all of the drawbacks of globally synchronous CPUs. For example, a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal. Higher clock rates in increasingly complex CPUs make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase (synchronized) throughout the entire unit. This has led many modern CPUs to require multiple identical clock signals to be provided to avoid delaying a single signal significantly enough to cause the CPU to malfunction. Another major issue, as clock rates increase dramatically, is the amount of heat that isdissipated by the CPU. The constantly changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time. In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static state. Therefore, as clock rate increases, so does energy consumption, causing the CPU to require moreheat dissipationin the form ofCPU coolingsolutions.

One method of dealing with the switching of unneeded components is calledclock gating, which involves turning off the clock signal to unneeded components (effectively disabling them). However, this is often regarded as difficult to implement and therefore does not see common usage outside of very low-power designs. One notable CPU design that uses extensive clock gating is the IBMPowerPC-basedXenonused in theXbox 360; this reduces the power requirements of the Xbox 360.[75]

Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether. While removing the global clock signal makes the design process considerably more complex in many ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages in power consumption andheat dissipationin comparison with similar synchronous designs. While somewhat uncommon, entireasynchronous CPUshave been built without using a global clock signal. Two notable examples of this are theARMcompliantAMULETand theMIPSR3000 compatible MiniMIPS.[76]

Rather than totally removing the clock signal, some CPU designs allow certain portions of the device to be asynchronous, such as using asynchronousALUsin conjunction with superscalar pipelining to achieve some arithmetic performance gains. While it is not altogether clear whether totally asynchronous designs can perform at a comparable or better level than their synchronous counterparts, it is evident that they do at least excel in simpler math operations. This, combined with their excellent power consumption and heat dissipation properties, makes them very suitable forembedded computers.[77]

Many modern CPUs have a die-integrated power managing module which regulates on-demand voltage supply to the CPU circuitry allowing it to keep balance between performance and power consumption.

Every CPU represents numerical values in a specific way. For example, some early digital computers represented numbers as familiardecimal(base 10)numeral systemvalues, and others have employed more unusual representations such asbi-quinary coded decimal(base 2–5) orternary(base 3). Nearly all modern CPUs represent numbers inbinaryform, with each digit being represented by some two-valued physical quantity such as a "high" or "low"voltage.[g]

Related to numeric representation is the size and precision of integer numbers that a CPU can represent. In the case of a binary CPU, this is measured by the number of bits (significant digits of a binary encoded integer) that the CPU can process in one operation, which is commonly calledword size,bit width,data path width,integer precision, orinteger size. A CPU's integer size determines the range of integer values on which it can directly operate.[h]For example, an8-bitCPU can directly manipulate integers represented by eight bits, which have a range of 256 (28) discrete integer values.

Integer range can also affect the number of memory locations the CPU can directly address (an address is an integer value representing a specific memory location). For example, if a binary CPU uses 32 bits to represent a memory address then it can directly address 232memory locations. To circumvent this limitation and for various other reasons, some CPUs use mechanisms (such asmemory managementorbank switching) that allow additional memory to be addressed.

CPUs with larger word sizes require more circuitry and consequently are physically larger, cost more and consume more power (and therefore generate more heat). As a result, smaller 4- or 8-bitmicrocontrollersare commonly used in modern applications even though CPUs with much larger word sizes (such as 16, 32, 64, even 128-bit) are available. When higher performance is required, however, the benefits of a larger word size (larger data ranges and address spaces) may outweigh the disadvantages. A CPU can have internal data paths shorter than the word size to reduce size and cost. For example, even though theIBM System/360instruction set architecturewas a 32-bit instruction set, the System/360Model 30andModel 40had 8-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required four cycles, one for each 8 bits of the operands, and, even though theMotorola 68000 seriesinstruction set was a 32-bit instruction set, theMotorola 68000andMotorola 68010had 16-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required two cycles.

To gain some of the advantages afforded by both lower and higher bit lengths, manyinstruction setshave different bit widths for integer and floating-point data, allowing CPUs implementing that instruction set to have different bit widths for different portions of the device. For example, the IBMSystem/360instruction set was primarily 32 bit, but supported 64-bitfloating-pointvalues to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating-point numbers.[37]The System/360 Model 65 had an 8-bit adder for decimal and fixed-point binary arithmetic and a 60-bit adder for floating-point arithmetic.[78]Many later CPU designs use similar mixed bit width, especially when the processor is meant for general-purpose use where a reasonable balance of integer and floating-point capability is required.

The description of the basic operation of a CPU offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take. This type of CPU, usually referred to assubscalar, operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time, that is less than oneinstruction per clock cycle(IPC < 1).

This process gives rise to an inherent inefficiency in subscalar CPUs. Since only one instruction is executed at a time, the entire CPU must wait for that instruction to complete before proceeding to the next instruction. As a result, the subscalar CPU gets "hung up" on instructions which take more than one clock cycle to complete execution. Even adding a secondexecution unit(see below) does not improve performance much; rather than one pathway being hung up, now two pathways are hung up and the number of unused transistors is increased. This design, wherein the CPU's execution resources can operate on only one instruction at a time, can only possibly reachscalarperformance (one instruction per clock cycle,IPC = 1). However, the performance is nearly always subscalar (less than one instruction per clock cycle,IPC < 1).

Attempts to achieve scalar and better performance have resulted in a variety of design methodologies that cause the CPU to behave less linearly and more in parallel. When referring to parallelism in CPUs, two terms are generally used to classify these design techniques:

Each methodology differs both in the ways in which they are implemented, as well as the relative effectiveness they afford in increasing the CPU's performance for an application.[i]

One of the simplest methods for increased parallelism is to begin the first steps of instruction fetching and decoding before the prior instruction finishes executing. This is a technique known asinstruction pipelining, and is used in almost all modern general-purpose CPUs. Pipelining allows multiple instructions to be executed at a time by breaking the execution pathway into discrete stages. This separation can be compared to an assembly line, in which an instruction is made more complete at each stage until it exits the execution pipeline and is retired.

Pipelining does, however, introduce the possibility for a situation where the result of the previous operation is needed to complete the next operation; a condition often termed data dependency conflict. Therefore, pipelined processors must check for these sorts of conditions and delay a portion of the pipeline if necessary. A pipelined processor can become very nearly scalar, inhibited only by pipeline stalls (an instruction spending more than one clock cycle in a stage).

Improvements in instruction pipelining led to further decreases in the idle time of CPU components. Designs that are said to be superscalar include a long instruction pipeline and multiple identicalexecution units, such asload–store units,arithmetic–logic units,floating-point unitsandaddress generation units.[79]In a superscalar pipeline, instructions are read and passed to a dispatcher, which decides whether or not the instructions can be executed in parallel (simultaneously). If so, they are dispatched to execution units, resulting in their simultaneous execution. In general, the number of instructions that a superscalar CPU will complete in a cycle is dependent on the number of instructions it is able to dispatch simultaneously to execution units.

Most of the difficulty in the design of a superscalar CPU architecture lies in creating an effective dispatcher. The dispatcher needs to be able to quickly determine whether instructions can be executed in parallel, as well as dispatch them in such a way as to keep as many execution units busy as possible. This requires that the instruction pipeline is filled as often as possible and requires significant amounts ofCPU cache. It also makeshazard-avoiding techniques likebranch prediction,speculative execution,register renaming,out-of-order executionandtransactional memorycrucial to maintaining high levels of performance. By attempting to predict which branch (or path) a conditional instruction will take, the CPU can minimize the number of times that the entire pipeline must wait until a conditional instruction is completed. Speculative execution often provides modest performance increases by executing portions of code that may not be needed after a conditional operation completes. Out-of-order execution somewhat rearranges the order in which instructions are executed to reduce delays due to data dependencies. Also in case ofsingle instruction stream, multiple data stream, a case when a lot of data from the same type has to be processed, modern processors can disable parts of the pipeline so that when a single instruction is executed many times, the CPU skips the fetch and decode phases and thus greatly increases performance on certain occasions, especially in highly monotonous program engines such as video creation software and photo processing.

When a fraction of the CPU is superscalar, the part that is not suffers a performance penalty due to scheduling stalls. The IntelP5Pentiumhad two superscalar ALUs which could accept one instruction per clock cycle each, but its FPU could not. Thus the P5 was integer superscalar but not floating point superscalar. Intel's successor to the P5 architecture,P6, added superscalar abilities to its floating-point features.

Simple pipelining and superscalar design increase a CPU's ILP by allowing it to execute instructions at rates surpassing one instruction per clock cycle. Most modern CPU designs are at least somewhat superscalar, and nearly all general purpose CPUs designed in the last decade are superscalar. In later years some of the emphasis in designing high-ILP computers has been moved out of the CPU's hardware and into its software interface, orinstruction set architecture(ISA). The strategy of thevery long instruction word(VLIW) causes some ILP to become implied directly by the software, reducing the CPU's work in boosting ILP and thereby reducing design complexity.

Another strategy of achieving performance is to execute multiplethreadsorprocessesin parallel. This area of research is known asparallel computing.[80]InFlynn's taxonomy, this strategy is known asmultiple instruction stream, multiple data stream(MIMD).[81]

One technology used for this purpose ismultiprocessing(MP).[82]The initial type of this technology is known assymmetric multiprocessing(SMP), where a small number of CPUs share a coherent view of their memory system. In this scheme, each CPU has additional hardware to maintain a constantly up-to-date view of memory. By avoiding stale views of memory, the CPUs can cooperate on the same program and programs can migrate from one CPU to another. To increase the number of cooperating CPUs beyond a handful, schemes such asnon-uniform memory access(NUMA) anddirectory-based coherence protocolswere introduced in the 1990s. SMP systems are limited to a small number of CPUs while NUMA systems have been built with thousands of processors. Initially, multiprocessing was built using multiple discrete CPUs and boards to implement the interconnect between the processors. When the processors and their interconnect are all implemented on a single chip, the technology is known as chip-level multiprocessing (CMP) and the single chip as amulti-core processor.

It was later recognized that finer-grain parallelism existed with a single program. A single program might have several threads (or functions) that could be executed separately or in parallel. Some of the earliest examples of this technology implementedinput/outputprocessing such asdirect memory accessas a separate thread from the computation thread. A more general approach to this technology was introduced in the 1970s when systems were designed to run multiple computation threads in parallel. This technology is known asmulti-threading(MT). The approach is considered more cost-effective than multiprocessing, as only a small number of components within a CPU are replicated to support MT as opposed to the entire CPU in the case of MP. In MT, the execution units and the memory system including the caches are shared among multiple threads. The downside of MT is that the hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software than that of MP and thus supervisor software like operating systems have to undergo larger changes to support MT. One type of MT that was implemented is known astemporal multithreading, where one thread is executed until it is stalled waiting for data to return from external memory. In this scheme, the CPU would then quickly context switch to another thread which is ready to run, the switch often done in one CPU clock cycle, such as theUltraSPARC T1. Another type of MT issimultaneous multithreading, where instructions from multiple threads are executed in parallel within one CPU clock cycle.

For several decades from the 1970s to early 2000s, the focus in designing high performance general purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through technologies such as pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated in large, power-hungry CPUs such as the IntelPentium 4. By the early 2000s, CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques.

CPU designers then borrowed ideas from commercial computing markets such astransaction processing, where the aggregate performance of multiple programs, also known asthroughputcomputing, was more important than the performance of a single thread or process.

This reversal of emphasis is evidenced by the proliferation of dual and more core processor designs and notably, Intel's newer designs resembling its less superscalarP6architecture. Late designs in several processor families feature chip-level multiprocessing, including thex86-64OpteronandAthlon 64 X2, theSPARCUltraSPARC T1, IBMPOWER4andPOWER5, as well as severalvideo game consoleCPUs like theXbox 360's triple-core PowerPC design, and thePlayStation 3's 7-coreCell microprocessor.

A less common but increasingly important paradigm of processors (and indeed, computing in general) deals with data parallelism. The processors discussed earlier are all referred to as some type of scalar device.[j]As the name implies, vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data in the context of one instruction. This contrasts with scalar processors, which deal with one piece of data for every instruction. UsingFlynn's taxonomy, these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to assingle instructionstream,multiple datastream (SIMD) andsingle instructionstream,single datastream (SISD), respectively. The great utility in creating processors that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation (for example, a sum or adot product) to be performed on a large set of data. Some classic examples of these types of tasks includemultimediaapplications (images, video and sound), as well as many types ofscientificand engineering tasks. Whereas a scalar processor must complete the entire process of fetching, decoding and executing each instruction and value in a set of data, a vector processor can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction. This is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data.

Most early vector processors, such as theCray-1, were associated almost exclusively with scientific research andcryptographyapplications. However, as multimedia has largely shifted to digital media, the need for some form of SIMD in general-purpose processors has become significant. Shortly after inclusion offloating-point unitsstarted to become commonplace in general-purpose processors, specifications for and implementations of SIMD execution units also began to appear for general-purpose processors in the mid-1990s. Some of these early SIMD specifications – like HP'sMultimedia Acceleration eXtensions(MAX) and Intel'sMMX– were integer-only. This proved to be a significant impediment for some software developers, since many of the applications that benefit from SIMD primarily deal withfloating-pointnumbers. Progressively, developers refined and remade these early designs into some of the common modern SIMD specifications, which are usually associated with oneinstruction set architecture(ISA). Some notable modern examples include Intel'sStreaming SIMD Extensions(SSE) and the PowerPC-relatedAltiVec(also known as VMX).[k]

Many modern architectures (including embedded ones) often includehardware performance counters(HPC), which enables low-level (instruction-level) collection,benchmarking, debugging or analysis of running software metrics.[83][84]HPC may also be used to discover and analyze unusual or suspicious activity of the software, such asreturn-oriented programming(ROP) orsigreturn-oriented programming(SROP) exploits etc.[85]This is usually done by software-security teams to assess and find malicious binary programs.[86]

Many major vendors (such asIBM,Intel,AMD, andArm) provide software interfaces (usually written in C/C++) that can be used to collect data from the CPU'sregistersin order to get metrics.[87]Operating system vendors also provide software likeperf(Linux) to record,benchmark, ortraceCPU events running kernels and applications.

Hardware counters provide a low-overhead method for collecting comprehensive performance metrics related to a CPU's core elements (functional units, caches, main memory, etc.) – a significant advantage over software profilers.[88]Additionally, they generally eliminate the need to modify the underlying source code of a program.[89]Because hardware designs differ between architectures, the specific types and interpretations of hardware counters will also change.

Cloud computingcan use virtualization to provide avirtual central processing unit[90](vCPU) for separate users;[91]vCPU is not to be confused with avirtual private server(VPS).

A host is the virtual equivalent of a physical machine, on which a virtual system is operating.[92]When there are several physical machines operating in tandem and managed as a whole, the grouped computing and memory resources form acluster. In some systems, it is possible to dynamically add and remove from a cluster. Resources available at a host and cluster level can be partitioned intoresources poolswith finegranularity.

Theperformanceorspeedof a processor depends on, among many other factors, the clock rate (generally given in multiples ofhertz) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors for theinstructions per second(IPS) that the CPU can perform.[93]Many reported IPS values have represented "peak" execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and applications, some of which take longer to execute than others. The performance of thememory hierarchyalso greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in IPS calculations. Because of these problems, various standardized tests, often called"benchmarks"for this purpose –  such asSPECint–  have been developed to attempt to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

Processing performance of computers is increased by usingmulti-core processors, which essentially is plugging two or more individual processors (calledcoresin this sense) into one integrated circuit.[94]Ideally, a dual core processor would be nearly twice as powerful as a single core processor. In practice, the performance gain is far smaller, only about 50%, due to imperfect software algorithms and implementation.[95]Increasing the number of cores in a processor (i.e. dual-core, quad-core, etc.) increases the workload that can be handled. This means that the processor can now handle numerous asynchronous events, interrupts, etc. which can take a toll on the CPU when overwhelmed. These cores can be thought of as different floors in a processing plant, with each floor handling a different task. Sometimes, these cores will handle the same tasks as cores adjacent to them if a single core is not enough to handle the information. Multi-core CPUs enhance a computer's ability to run several tasks simultaneously by providing additional processing power. However, the increase in speed is not directly proportional to the number of cores added. This is because the cores need to interact through specific channels, and this inter-core communication consumes a portion of the available processing speed.[96]

Due to specific capabilities of modern CPUs, such assimultaneous multithreadinganduncore, which involve sharing of actual CPU resources while aiming at increased utilization, monitoring performance levels and hardware use gradually became a more complex task.[97]As a response, some CPUs implement additional hardware logic that monitors actual use of various parts of a CPU and provides various counters accessible to software; an example is Intel'sPerformance Counter Monitortechnology.[9]

Overclockingis a process of increasing theclock speedof a CPU (and other components) beyond their rated speeds. Increasing a component's clock rate causes it to perform more operations per second.[98]Overclocking might increase CPU temperature and cause it tooverheat, so most users do not overclock and leave the clock speed unchanged. Some versions of components (such asIntel's U version of its CPUsorNvidia's OGGPUs) do not allow overclocking.

Article: Random-access memory

Random-access memory(RAM;/ræm/) is a form ofelectronic computer memorythat can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store workingdataandmachine code.[1][2]Arandom-accessmemory device allows data items to bereador written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such ashard disksandmagnetic tape), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

In modern technology, random-access memory takes the form ofintegrated circuit(IC) chips withMOS(metal–oxide–semiconductor)memory cells. RAM is normally associated withvolatiletypes of memory where stored information is lost if power is removed. The two main types of volatile random-accesssemiconductor memoryarestatic random-access memory(SRAM) anddynamic random-access memory(DRAM).

Non-volatile RAM has also been developed[3]and other types ofnon-volatile memoriesallow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations. These include most types ofROMandNOR flash memory.

The use of semiconductor RAM dates back to 1965 when IBM introduced the monolithic (single-chip) 16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for theirSystem/360 Model 95computer, andToshibaused bipolar DRAM memory cells for its 180-bit Toscal BC-1411electronic calculator, both based onbipolar transistors. While it offered higher speeds thanmagnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.[4]In 1966, Dr.Robert Dennardinvented modern DRAM architecture in which there's a single MOS transistor per capacitor.[5]The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1KIntel 1103, was introduced in October 1970.Synchronous dynamic random-access memory(SDRAM) was reintroduced with theSamsungKM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

Early computers usedrelays,mechanical counters[6]ordelay linesfor main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines wereserial deviceswhich could only reproduce data in the order it was written.Drum memorycould be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items requires knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out oftriode vacuum tubes, and later, out ofdiscrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such asregisters. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally, only a few dozen or few hundredbitsof such memory could be provided.

The first practical form of random-access memory was theWilliams tube. It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of acathode-ray tube. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at theUniversity of Manchesterin England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in theManchester Babycomputer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June, 1948.[7]In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was atestbedto demonstrate the reliability of the memory.[8][9]

Magnetic-core memorywas invented in 1947 and developed up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings. By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible. Magnetic core memory was the standard form ofcomputer memoryuntil displaced bysemiconductor memoryinintegrated circuits(ICs) during the early 1970s.[10]

Prior to the development of integratedread-only memory(ROM) circuits,permanent(orread-only) random-access memory was often constructed usingdiode matricesdriven byaddress decoders, or specially woundcore rope memoryplanes.[citation needed]

Semiconductor memoryappeared in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which usedbipolar transistors. Although it was faster, it could not compete with the lower price of magnetic core memory.[11]

In 1957, Frosch and Derick manufactured the first silicon dioxide field-effect transistors at Bell Labs, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface.[12]Subsequently, in 1960, a team demonstrated a workingMOSFETat Bell Labs.[13][14]This led to the development ofmetal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS) memory by John Schmidt atFairchild Semiconductorin 1964.[10][15]In addition to higher speeds, MOSsemiconductor memorywas cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory.[10]The development ofsilicon-gateMOS integrated circuit(MOS IC) technology byFederico Fagginat Fairchild in 1968 enabled the production of MOSmemory chips.[16]MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s.[10]

Integrated bipolarstatic random-access memory(SRAM) was invented by Robert H. Norman atFairchild Semiconductorin 1963.[17]It was followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964.[10]SRAM became an alternative to magnetic-core memory, but required six MOS transistors for each bit of data.[18]Commercial use of SRAM began in 1965, whenIBMintroduced the SP95 memory chip for theSystem/360 Model 95.[11]

Dynamic random-access memory(DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4- or 6-transistor latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly increasing memory density at the cost of volatility. Data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor and had to be periodicallyrefreshedevery few milliseconds before the charge could leak away.

Toshiba's Toscal BC-1411electronic calculator, which was introduced in 1965,[19][20][21]used a form of capacitor bipolar DRAM, storing 180-bit data on discretememory cells, consisting ofgermaniumbipolar transistors and capacitors.[20][21]Capacitors had also been used for earlier memory schemes, such as the drum of theAtanasoff–Berry Computer, theWilliams tubeand theSelectron tube. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.[22]

In 1966,Robert Dennard, while examining the characteristics of MOS technology, found it was capable of buildingcapacitors, and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit, and the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor. This led to his development of modern DRAM architecture for which there is a single MOS transistor per capacitor.[18]In 1967, Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a single-transistor DRAM memory cell, based on MOS technology.[18][23]The first commercial DRAM IC chip was theIntel 1103, which wasmanufacturedon an8μmMOS process with a capacity of 1kbit, and was released in 1970.[10][24][25]

The earliest DRAMs were often synchronized with the CPU clock and were used with early microprocessors. In the mid-1970s, DRAMs moved to the asynchronous design, but in the 1990s returned to synchronous operation.[26][27]In 1992 Samsung released KM48SL2000, which had a capacity of 16Mbit.[28][29]The first commercialdouble data rateSDRAM was Samsung's 64MbitDDR SDRAM, released in June 1998.[30]GDDR(graphics DDR) is a form ofSGRAM(synchronous graphics RAM), which was first released by Samsung as a 16Mbit memory chip in 1998.[31]

In general, the termRAMrefers solely to solid-state memory devices, and more specifically the main memory in most computers. The two widely used forms of modern RAM arestatic RAM(SRAM) anddynamic RAM(DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of amemory cell, typically using six MOSFETs. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less static power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used ascache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor andcapacitorpair (typically a MOSFET andMOS capacitor, respectively),[32]which together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.

Both static and dynamic RAM are consideredvolatile, as their state is lost when power is removed from the system. By contrast,read-only memory(ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered. Writable variants of ROM (such asEEPROMandNOR flash) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data topersistwithout power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.

ECC memory(which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, usingparity bitsorerror correction codes.

The memory cell is the fundamental building block ofcomputer memory. The memory cell is anelectronic circuitthat stores one bit of binary information. The cell can be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

In SRAM, the memory cell is a type offlip-flopcircuit, usually implemented usingFETs. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is complex, expensive and has low storage density.

A second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a 1 or a 0 in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM.

To be useful, memory cells must be readable and writable. Within the RAM device,multiplexing and demultiplexingcircuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address linesA0,A1,...An{\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1},...A_{n}}, and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are selected. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two.

Usually, several memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4-bit-wide RAM chip has four memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and that of the microprocessor are different; for a 32-bit microprocessor, eight 4-bit RAM chips would be needed.

Often, more addresses are needed than can be provided by a single device. In that case, multiple devices are used, with external multiplexors used to select the device assigned to a specific address range. RAM is often byte addressable, although word-addressable RAM also exists.[33][34]

Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting ofprocessor registers, on-dieSRAMcaches, externalcaches,DRAM,memory pagingsystems andvirtual memoryorswap spaceon aSSDorhard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as RAM from a programming perspective. The overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the fastest possible averageaccess timewhile minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system.

In addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications, RAM is used in numerous other ways.

Most modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity, known as "virtual memory". A portion of the computer'shard driveis set aside for apaging fileor ascratch partition, and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system's total memory. (For example, if a computer has 2 GB (10243B) of RAM and a 1 GB page file, the operating system has 3 GB total memory available to it.) When the system runs low on physical memory, it can "swap" portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data, as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM. Excessive use of this mechanism results inthrashingand generally hampers overall system performance, mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM.

Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM, allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called aRAM disk. A RAM disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source, or changes to the RAM disk are written out to a nonvolatile disk. The RAM disk is reloaded from the physical disk upon RAM disk initialization.

Sometimes, the contents of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often write-protected). This process, sometimes calledshadowing, is fairly common in both computers andembedded systems.

As a common example, theBIOSin typical personal computers often has an option called "use shadow BIOS" or similar. When enabled, functions that rely on data from the BIOS's ROM instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities. For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to theoperating systemif shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed ROMs.[35]

Somevirtual private networkservices utilize RAM servers to keep all runtime state including session metadata and cryptographic material involatile memoryso that a power cycle or reboot clears it, reducing persistent forensic artifacts relative to disk-backed designs.[36][37]In such a design, no data is written to hard drives; all information resides in volatile memory and is erased whenever the server is powered off or rebooted.[38]

Thememory wallis the growing disparity of speed between CPU and the response time of memory (known asmemory latency) outside the CPU chip. An important reason for this disparity is the limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries. From 1986 to 2000,CPUspeed improved at an annual rate of 55% while off-chip memory response time only improved at 10%. Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelmingbottleneckin computer performance.[39]

Another reason for the disparity is the enormous increase in the size of memory since the start of the PC revolution in the 1980s. Originally, PCs contained less than 1 mebibyte of RAM, which often had a response time of 1 CPU clock cycle, meaning that it required 0 wait states. Larger memory units are inherently slower than smaller ones of the same type, simply because it takes longer for signals to traverse a larger circuit. Constructing a memory unit of many gibibytes with a response time of one clock cycle is difficult or impossible. Modern CPUs often still have a mebibyte of 0 wait state cache memory, but it resides on the same chip as the CPU cores due to the bandwidth limitations of chip-to-chip communication. It must also be constructed from static RAM, which is far more expensive than the dynamic RAM used for larger memories. Static RAM also consumes far more power.

CPU speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense.Intelsummarized these causes in a 2005 document.[40]

First of all, as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, the transistorleakage currentincreases, leading to excess power consumption and heat... Secondly, the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency, since memory access times have not been able to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies. Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-calledvon Neumann bottleneck), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy. In addition, partly due to limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices,resistance-capacitance(RC) delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink, imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address.

The RC delays in signal transmission were also noted in "Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures"[41]which projected a maximum of 12.5% average annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014.

A different concept is the processor-memory performance gap, which can be addressed by3D integrated circuitsthat reduce the distance between the logic and memory aspects that are further apart in a 2D chip.[42]Memory subsystem design requires a focus on the gap, which is widening over time.[43]The main method of bridging the gap is the use ofcaches; small amounts of high-speed memory that houses recent operations and instructions nearby the processor, speeding up the execution of those operations or instructions in cases where they are called upon frequently. Multiple levels of caching have been developed to deal with the widening gap, and the performance of high-speed modern computers relies on evolving caching techniques.[44]There can be up to a 53% difference between the growth in speed of processor and the lagging speed of main memory access.[45]

Solid-state hard driveshave continued to increase in speed, from ~400 Mbit/s viaSATA3in 2012 up to ~7 GB/s viaNVMe/PCIein 2024, closing the gap between RAM and hard disk speeds, although RAM continues to be an order of magnitude faster, with single-laneDDR58000MHz capable of 128 GB/s, and modernGDDReven faster. Fast, cheap,non-volatilesolid state drives have replaced some functions formerly performed by RAM, such as holding certain data for immediate availability inserver farms- 1terabyteof SSD storage can be had for $200, while 1 TB of RAM would cost thousands of dollars.[46][47]

Article: Solid-state drive

Asolid-state drive(SSD) is a type ofsolid-state storagedevice that usesintegrated circuitsto store datapersistently. It is sometimes calledsemiconductor storage device,solid-state device, orsolid-state disk.[1][2]

SSDs rely on non-volatile memory, typicallyNAND flash, to store data in memory cells. The performance and endurance of SSDs vary depending on the number of bits stored per cell, ranging from high-performing single-level cells (SLC) to more affordable but slower quad-level cells (QLC). In addition to flash-based SSDs, other technologies such as3D XPointoffer faster speeds and higher endurance through different data storage mechanisms.

Unlike traditionalhard disk drives(HDDs), SSDs have no moving parts, allowing them to deliver faster data access speeds, reduced latency, increased resistance to physical shock, lower power consumption, and silent operation.

Often interfaced to a system in the same way as HDDs, SSDs are used in a variety of devices, includingpersonal computers,enterprise servers, andmobile devices. However, SSDs are generally more expensive on a per-gigabyte basis and have a finite number of write cycles, which can lead to data loss over time. Despite these limitations, SSDs are increasingly replacing HDDs, especially in performance-critical applications and as primary storage in many consumer devices.

SSDs come in various form factors and interface types, includingSATA,PCIe, andNVMe, each offering different levels of performance. Hybrid storage solutions, such assolid-state hybrid drives(SSHDs), combine SSD and HDD technologies to offer improved performance at a lower cost than pure SSDs.

An SSD stores data insemiconductorcells, with its properties varying according to the number ofbitsstored in each cell (between 1 and 4). Single-level cells (SLC) store one bit of data per cell and provide higher performance and endurance. In contrast, multi-level cells (MLC), triple-level cells (TLC), and quad-level cells (QLC) store more data per cell but have lower performance and endurance. SSDs using3D XPointtechnology, such as Intel's Optane, store data by changing electrical resistance instead of storing electrical charges in cells, which can provide faster speeds and longer data persistence compared to conventional flash memory.[3]SSDs based onNAND flashslowly leak charge when not powered, while heavily used consumer drives may start losing data typically after one to two years unpowered in storage.[4]SSDs have a limited lifetime number of writes, and also slow down as they reach their full storage capacity.[citation needed]

SSDs also have internal parallelism that allows them to manage multiple operations simultaneously, which enhances their performance.[5]

Unlike HDDs and similarelectromechanicalmagnetic storage, SSDs do not have moving mechanical parts, which provides advantages such as resistance to physical shock, quieter operation, and faster access times. Their lower latency results in higher input/output rates (IOPS) than HDDs.[6]

Some SSDs are combined with traditional hard drives in hybrid configurations, such as Intel'sHystorand Apple'sFusion Drive. These drives use both flash memory and spinning magnetic disks in order to improve the performance of frequently accessed data.[7][8]

Traditional interfaces (e.g.SATAandSAS) andstandard HDD form factorsallow such SSDs to be used as drop-in replacements for HDDs in computers and other devices. Newer form factors such asmSATA,M.2,U.2,NF1/M.3/NGSFF,[9][10]XFM Express(Crossover Flash Memory, form factor XT2)[11]andEDSFF[12][13]and higher speed interfaces such asNVM Express(NVMe) overPCI Express(PCIe) can further increase performance over HDD performance.[3]

Traditional HDDbenchmarkstend to focus on the performance characteristics such asrotational latencyandseek time. As SSDs do not need to spin or seek to locate data, they are vastly superior to HDDs in such tests. However, SSDs have challenges with mixed reads and writes, and their performance may degrade over time. Therefore, SSD testing typically looks at when the full drive is first used, as the new and empty drive may have much better write performance than it would show after only weeks of use.[14]

The reliability of both HDDs and SSDs varies greatly among models.[15]Some field failure rates indicate that SSDs are significantly more reliable than HDDs.[16][17]However, SSDs are sensitive to sudden power interruption, sometimes resulting in aborted writes or even cases of the complete loss of the drive.[18]

Most of the advantages of solid-state drives over traditional hard drives are due to their ability to access data completely electronically instead of electromechanically, resulting in superior transfer speeds and mechanical ruggedness.[19]On the other hand, hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity for their price.[6][20]

In traditional HDDs, a rewritten file will generally occupy the same location on the disk surface as the original file, whereas in SSDs the new copy will often be written to different NAND cells for the purpose ofwear leveling. The wear-leveling algorithms are complex and difficult to test exhaustively. As a result, one major cause of data loss in SSDs is firmware bugs.[21][22]

While bothmemory cardsand most SSDs use flash memory, they have very different characteristics, including power consumption, performance, size, and reliability. Originally, solid state drives were shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. In contrast, memory cards (such asSecure Digital(SD),CompactFlash(CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.[40]

SSDs have differentfailure modesfrom traditional magnetic hard drives. Because solid-state drives contain no moving parts, they are generally not subject to mechanical failures. However, other types of failures can occur. For example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power loss may be more problematic than with HDDs, and the failure of a single chip may result in the loss of all data stored on it. Nonetheless, studies indicate that SSDs are generally reliable, often exceed their manufacturer-stated lifespan[41][42]and have lower failure rates than HDDs.[41]However, studies also note that SSDs experience higher rates of uncorrectable errors, which can lead to data loss, compared to HDDs.[43]

Manufacturers often calculate DW/D and TBW with worse conditions than those present in most real situations, such as the host operating system not supporting or having disabled support for4 KB sector alignmentorTRIM.[45]For example, aSamsung 970 EVO NVMe M.2SSD (2018) with 1 TB of capacity has an endurance rating of 600 TBW.[46]

Recovering data from SSDs presents challenges due to the non-linear and complex nature of data storage in solid-state drives. The internal operations of SSDs vary by manufacturer, with commands (e.g.TRIMand the ATA Secure Erase) and programs like (e.g.hdparm) being able to erase and modify the bits of a deleted file.

TheJEDEC Solid State Technology Association(JEDEC) has established standards for SSD reliability metrics, which include:[47]

In adistributed computingenvironment, SSDs can be used as adistributed cachelayer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to slower HDD-based backend storage systems. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system would, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as a distributedkey-value databaseand a distributedfile system. On supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to asburst buffer.

Flash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purposepersonal computerhardware. Awrite protectedflash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.[citation needed]

SSDs based on anSD cardwith alive SDoperating system are easilywrite-locked. Combined with acloud computingenvironment or other writable medium, anOSbootedfrom a write-locked SD card is reliable, persistent and impervious to permanent corruption.

In 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for theirZ68chipset (and mobile derivatives) calledSmart Response Technology, which allows aSATASSD to be used as acache(configurable as write-through orwrite-back) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.[48]A similar technology is available on HighPoint's RocketHybridPCIecard.[49]

Solid-state hybrid drives(SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from themagnetic storageby the host usingATA-8commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft'sReadyDrivetechnology explicitly stores portions of thehibernation filein the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.[50]

Dual-drive hybrid systemsare combining the usage of separate SSD and HDD devices installed in the same computer, with overall performance optimization managed by the computer user, or by the computer'soperating systemsoftware. Examples of this type of system arebcacheanddm-cacheonLinux,[51]and Apple'sFusion Drive.

The primary components of an SSD are the controller and the memory used to store data. Traditionally, early SSDs used volatileDRAMfor storage, but since 2009, most SSDs utilize non-volatileNAND flashmemory, which retains data even when powered off.[52][3]Flash memory SSDs store data inmetal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS) integrated circuit chips, using non-volatilefloating-gatememory cells.[53]

Every SSD includes a controller, which manages the data flow between the NAND memory and the host computer. The controller is an embedded processor that runs firmware to optimize performance, managing data, and ensuring data integrity.[54][55]

The overall performance of an SSD can scale with the number of parallel NAND chips and the efficiency of the controller. For example, controllers that enable parallel processing of NAND flash chips can improve bandwidth and reduce latency.[57]

Micron and Intel pioneered faster SSDs by implementing techniques such as data striping and interleaving to enhance read/write speeds.[58]More recently, SandForce introduced controllers that incorporate data compression to reduce the amount of data written to the flash memory, potentially increasing both performance and endurance.[59]

Wear leveling is a technique used in SSDs to ensure that write and erase operations are distributed evenly across all blocks of the flash memory. Without this, specific blocks could wear out prematurely due to repeated use, reducing the overall lifespan of the SSD. The process moves data that is infrequently changed (cold data) from heavily used blocks, so that data that changes more frequently (hot data) can be written to those blocks. This helps distribute wear more evenly across the entire SSD. However, this process introduces additional writes, known as write amplification, which must be managed to balance performance and durability.[60][61]

Most SSDs use non-volatileNANDflash memory for data storage, primarily due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to retain data without a constant power supply. NAND flash-based SSDs store data in semiconductor cells, with the specific architecture influencing performance, endurance, and cost.[63]

Over time, SSD controllers have improved the efficiency of NAND flash, incorporating techniques such asinterleaved memory, advanced error correction, and wear leveling to optimize performance and extend the lifespan of the drive.[65][66][67][68][69]Lower-end SSDs often use QLC or TLC memory, while higher-end drives for enterprise or performance-critical applications may use MLC or SLC.[70]

In addition to the flat (planar) NAND structure, many SSDs now use 3D NAND (or V-NAND), where memory cells are stacked vertically, increasing storage density while improving performance and reducing costs.[71]

Some SSDs use volatile DRAM instead of NAND flash, offering very high-speed data access but requiring a constant power supply to retain data. DRAM-based SSDs are typically used in specialized applications where performance is prioritized over cost or non-volatility. Many SSDs, such asNVDIMMdevices, are equipped with backup power sources such as internal batteries or external AC/DC adapters. These power sources ensure data is transferred to a backup system (usually NAND flash or another storage medium) in the event of power loss, preventing data corruption or loss.[72][73]Similarly,ULLtraDIMMdevices use components designed for DIMM modules, but only use flash memory, similar to a DRAM SSD.[74]

DRAM-based SSDs are often used for tasks where data must be accessed at high speeds with low latency, such as in high-performance computing or certain server environments.[75]

3D XPoint is a type of non-volatile memory technology developed by Intel and Micron, announced in 2015.[76]It operates by changing the electrical resistance of materials in its cells, offering much faster access times than NAND flash. 3D XPoint-based SSDs, such as Intel's Optane drives, provide lower latency and higher endurance than NAND-based drives, although they are more expensive per gigabyte.[77][78]

Drives known ashybrid drivesorsolid-state hybrid drives(SSHDs) use a hybrid of spinning disks and flash memory.[79][80]Some SSDs usemagnetoresistive random-access memory(MRAM) for storing data.[81][82]

Many flash-based SSDs include a small amount of volatile DRAM as a cache, similar to thebuffersin hard disk drives. This cache can temporarily hold data while it is being written to the flash memory, and it also stores metadata such as the mapping of logical blocks to physical locations on the SSD.[57]This cache may also temporarily hold data while it being recently read from the flash memory.

Some SSD controllers, like those from SandForce, achieve high performance without using an external DRAM cache. These designs rely on other mechanisms, such as on-chip SRAM, to manage data and minimize power consumption.[83]

Additionally, some SSDs use anSLC buffermechanism to temporarily store data in single-level cell (SLC) mode, even on multi-level cell (MLC) or triple-level cell (TLC) SSDs. This improves write performance by allowing data to be written to faster SLC storage before being moved to slower, higher-capacity MLC or TLC storage.[84]

On NVMe SSDs, Host Memory Buffer (HMB) technology allows the SSD to use a portion of the system's DRAM instead of relying on a built-in DRAM cache, reducing costs while maintaining a high level of performance.[83]

In certain high-end consumer and enterprise SSDs, larger amounts of DRAM are included to cache both file table mappings and written data, reducing write amplification and enhances overall performance.[85]

Higher-performing SSDs may include a capacitor or battery, which helps preserve data integrity in the event of an unexpected power loss. The capacitor or battery provides enough power to allow the data in the cache to be written to the non-volatile memory, ensuring no data is lost.[83][86]

In some SSDs that use multi-level cell (MLC) flash memory, a potential issue known as "lower page corruption" can occur if power is lost while programming an upper page. This can result in previously written data becoming corrupted. To address this, some high-end SSDs incorporatesupercapacitorsto ensure all data can be safely written during a sudden power loss.[87]

Some consumer SSDs have built-in capacitors to save critical data such as theFlash Translation Layer(FTL) mapping table. Examples include the Crucial M500 and Intel 320 series.[88]Enterprise-class SSDs, such as the Intel DC S3700 series, often come with more robust power-loss protection mechanisms like supercapacitors or batteries.[89]

The host interface of an SSD refers to the physical connector and the signaling methods used to communicate between the SSD and the host system. This interface is managed by the SSD's controller and is often similar to those found in traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). Common interfaces include:

SSDs may support various logical interfaces, which define the command sets used by operating systems to communicate with the SSD. Two common logical interfaces include:

The size and shape of any device are largely driven by the size and shape of the components used to make that device. Traditional HDDs andoptical drivesare designed around the rotatingplatter(s) oroptical discalong with thespindle motorinside. Since an SSD is made up of various interconnectedintegrated circuits(ICs) and an interface connector, its shape is no longer limited to the shape of rotating media drives. The lack of moving parts and light weight meant that an SSD can have no shell and simply appear in the shape of a plug-in board. On the other end of the size spectrum, some solid-state storage solutions come in a larger chassis that may even be a rack-mount form factor with numerous SSDs inside. They would all connect to a common bus inside the chassis and connect outside the box with a single connector.[3]

For general computer use, the 2.5-inch form factor (typically found in laptops and used for most SATA SSDs) was the most popular in the 2010s, in three thicknesses[98](7.0mm, 9.5mm, 14.8 or 15.0mm; with 12.0mm also available for some models). For desktop computers with 3.5-inch hard disk drive slots, a simple adapter plate can be used to make such a drive fit. Other types of form factors are more common in enterprise applications. An SSD can also be completely integrated in the other circuitry of the device, as in theAppleMacBook Air(starting with the fall 2010 model).[99]As of 2014[update],mSATAandM.2form factors also gained popularity, primarily in laptops.

The benefit of using a currentHDD form factorwould be to take advantage of the extensive infrastructure already in place to mount and connect the drives to the host system.[3][100]These traditional form factors are known by the size of the rotating media (i.e., 5.25-inch, 3.5-inch, 2.5-inch or 1.8-inch) and not the dimensions of the drive casing.

Adisk-on-a-module(DOM) is a flash drive with either 40/44-pinParallel ATA(PATA) orSATAinterface, intended to be plugged directly into the motherboard and used as a computerhard disk drive(HDD). DOM devices emulate a traditional hard disk drive, resulting in no need for special drivers or other specific operating system support. DOMs are usually used inembedded systems, which are often deployed in harsh environments where mechanical HDDs would simply fail, or inthin clientsbecause of small size, low power consumption, and silent operation.

SATA DOMs come in several forms. The most traditional emulates the standard interface, with the 7-pin SATA data connector placed beside the 15-pin SATA power connector. An example is the "half-slim SATA" MO-297 size standard. To save board space, smaller SATA DOMs were made that only use the SATA data connector. The earliest type, made by e.g.Supermicro, relied on a separateBerg connectorto deliver power. A second type of 2012, made byInnodisk, repurposes the 7th pin of the connector from GND to VCC (+5V).[101]A third type called "pin 8 power" replaces the two plastic structural elements on the sides with two metal contacts for GND and VCC.[102]These new types of SATADOMs are now so popular that the older 7+15-pin type is virtually not considered to be "SATADOMs" any more, especially as few motherboards provide such an interface. (PATA DOMs have no power concern as the connector supplies 3.3V or 5V power: the same way aCompactFlashwould get its power.)

As of 2016,[update]DOM storage capacities range from 4 MB to 128 GB with different variations in physical layouts, including vertical or horizontal orientation.[citation needed]

For applications where space is at a premium, like for ultrabooks ortablet computers, a few compact form factors were standardized for flash-based SSDs.

There is the mSATA form factor, which uses thePCI Express Mini Cardphysical layout. It remains electrically compatible with the PCI Express Mini Card interface specification while requiring an additional connection to the SATA host controller through the same connector. A higher-performance SSD may use the Mini-PCIe to access the PCIe bus directly.

M.2form factor, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a natural transition from the mSATA and physical layout it used, to a more usable and more advanced form factor. While mSATA took advantage of an existing form factor and connector, M.2 has been designed to maximize usage of the card space, while minimizing the footprint. The M.2 standard allows both SATA andPCI ExpressSSDs to be fitted onto M.2 modules.[103]

Before M.2 was standardized, one of the main ways to access the PCIe bus for faster-than-SATA/SAS speed on a server was through the PCIe slot. A common shape is called HHHL (Half Height Half Length), or AIC (Add in Card) SSDs.[104][105][106]

Some primitive PCIe SSDs do not access the PCIe bus directly, but simply had a PCIe-to-SATA/SAS bridge device and a number of SATA or SASflash controllersattached. This was considered acceptable in 2010,[107]when true PCIe SSDs were still new.[108]

This shape remains in use for some high performance, high capacity drives. The PCIe slot offers 16 lanes of data and 75 watts of power, still much larger than what a M.2 slot can provide. It also provides space for a largeheat sink. There are also adapter boards that converts other form factors, especially M.2 drives with PCIe interface, into regular add-in cards.

In the early 2000s, a few companies introduced SSDs inBall Grid Array(BGA) form factors, such as M-Systems' (nowSanDisk) DiskOnChip[109]andSilicon Storage Technology's NANDrive[110][111](now produced byGreenliant Systems), and Memoright's M1000[112]for use in embedded systems. The main benefits of BGA SSDs are their low power consumption, small chip package size to fit into compact subsystems, and that they can besoldereddirectly onto a system motherboard to reduce adverse effects from vibration and shock.[113]

Many of the DRAM-based solutions in 2014 use a box that is often designed to fit in a rack-mount system. The number ofDRAMcomponents required to get sufficient capacity to store the data along with the backup power supplies requires a larger space than traditional HDD form factors.[114]

The flexibility of the SSD also allows for many unusual form factors, some of which had been important in its early adoption in PCs.[115]For example, the SATADIMM from Viking Technology uses an empty DDR3 DIMM slot on the motherboard to provide power to the SSD with a separate SATA connector to provide the data connection back to the computer. The result is an easy-to-install SSD with a capacity equal to drives that typically take a full 2.5-inchdrive bay.[116]

The first devices resembling solid-state drives (SSDs) used semiconductor technology, with an early example being the1978 StorageTek STC 4305. This device was a plug-compatible replacement for theIBM 2305hard drive, initially usingcharge-coupled devicesfor storage and later switching todynamic random-access memory(DRAM). The STC 4305 was significantly faster than its mechanical counterparts and cost around $400,000 for a 45 MB capacity.[117]Though early SSD-like devices existed, they were not widely used due to their high cost and small storage capacity.

In the late 1980s, companies like Zitel began selling DRAM-based SSD products under the name "RAMDisk." These devices were primarily used in specialized systems like those made by UNIVAC and Perkin-Elmer.

Flash memory, a key component in modern SSDs, was invented in 1980 byFujio Masuokaat Toshiba.[126][127]Flash-based SSDs were patented  in 1989 by the founders ofSanDisk,[128]which released its first product in 1991: a 20 MB SSD for IBM laptops.[129]While the storage capacity was limited and the price high (around $1,000), this marked the beginning of a transition to flash memory as an alternative to traditional hard drives.[130]

In the 1990s, new manufacturers of flash memory drives emerged, includingSTEC, Inc.,[131]M-Systems,[132][133]andBiTMICRO.[134][135]

As the technology advanced, SSDs saw dramatic improvements in capacity, speed, and affordability.[136][137][138][139]By 2016, commercially available SSDs had more capacity than the largest available HDDs.[140][141][142][143][144]By 2018, flash-based SSDs had reached capacities of up to 100 TB in enterprise products, with consumer SSDs offering up to 16 TB.[118]These advancements were accompanied by significant increases in read and write speeds, with some high-end consumer models reaching speeds of up to 14.5 GB/s.[120]

In 2021, NVMe 2.0 with Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) was announced. ZNS allows data to be mapped directly to its physical location in memory, providing direct access on an SSD without a flash translation layer.[145]In 2024, Samsung announced what it called the world's first SSD with a hybrid PCIe interface, the Samsung 990 EVO. The hybrid interface runs in either the x4 PCIe 4.0 or x2 PCIe 5.0 modes, a first for an M.2 SSD.[146]

SSD prices have also fallen dramatically, with the cost per gigabyte decreasing from around $50,000 in 1991 to less than $0.05 by 2020.[125]

Enterprise flash drives (EFDs) are designed for high-performance applications requiring fast input/output operations per second (IOPS), reliability, and energy efficiency. EFDs often have higher specifications than consumer SSDs, making them suitable for mission-critical applications. The term was first used by EMC in 2008 to describe SSDs built for enterprise environments.[147][148]

One example of an EFD is the Intel DC S3700 series, launched in 2012. These drives were notable for their consistent performance, maintaining IOPS variation within a narrow range, which is crucial for enterprise environments.[149]

Another significant product is the Toshiba PX02SS series, launched in 2016. Designed for write-intensive applications like online transaction processing, these drives achieved impressive read and write speeds and high endurance ratings.[150]

In 2017, Intel introduced SSDs based on 3D XPoint technology under the Optane brand. Unlike NAND flash, 3D XPoint uses a different method to store data, offering higher IOPS performance, although sequential read and write speeds remain slower compared to traditional SSDs.[151]

As SSD technology continues to improve, they are increasingly used in ultra-mobile PCs and lightweight laptop systems. The first flash-memory SSD based PC to become available was the Sony Vaio UX90, announced for pre-order on 27 June 2006 and began shipping in Japan on 3 July 2006 with a 16 GB flash memory hard drive.[152]Another of the first mainstream releases of SSD was theXO Laptop, built as part of theOne Laptop Per Childproject. Mass production of these computers, built for children in developing countries, began in December 2007. By 2009,Dell,[153][154][155]Toshiba,[156][157]Asus,[158]Apple,[159]andLenovo[160]had begun producing laptops with SSDs.

By 2010, Apple'sMacBook Airline began using solid state drives as the default.[161][159]In 2011, Intel'sUltrabookbecame the first widely available consumer computers using SSDs aside from the MacBook Air.[162]At present, SSD devices are widely used and distributed by anumber of companies, with a small number of companies manufacturing the NAND flash devices within them.[163]

SSD shipments were approximately 11 million units in 2009,[164]rising to 17.3 million units in 2011[165]for a total market value of US$5 billion.[166]Shipments continued to grow to 39 million units in 2012 and were projected to reach 83 million units in 2013,[167]201.4 million units in 2016,[165]and 227 million units in 2017.[168]

Tom's Hardware, citing a 2024 analysis from Yole Group, projected that SSD revenues will rise from USD 29 billion in 2022 to USD 67 billion by 2028.[169]

The global solid-state drive (SSD) market is projected to grow significantly between 2024 and 2030, driven by rising demand for data center expansion, cloud computing services, and consumer electronics upgrades.[170]In a 2024 report, Grand View Research estimated the SSD market at USD 19.1 billion in 2023 and projected it to reach USD 55.1 billion by 2030.[170]In a separate 2024 study, Mordor Intelligence valued the market at USD 63.45 billion for 2024, forecasting growth to USD 172.82 billion by 2030.[171]

The samefile systemsused on hard disk drives can typically also be used on solid state drives. File systems that support SSDs generally also support the TRIM command, which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data. The file system does not need to managewear levelingor other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Somelog-structured file systems(e.g.F2FS,JFFS2) help to reducewrite amplificationon SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updatingfile-system metadata.

If an operating system does not support using TRIM on discreteswappartitions, it might be possible to use swap files inside an ordinary file system instead. For example, macOS does not support swap partitions; it only swaps to files within a file system, so it can use TRIM when, for example, swap files are deleted.[citation needed]

Since 2010, standard Linux drive utilities have taken care of appropriate partition alignment by default.[172]

Kernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on 24 February 2010.[173]Theext4,Btrfs,XFS,JFS, andF2FSfile systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function. Non-native file systems such asexFATandNTFS-3Galso support TRIM. To automatically make use of TRIM on file deletion, a file system must be mounted using thediscardparameter. Linuxswappartitions are by default performing discard operations when the underlying drive supports TRIM, with the possibility to turn them off.[174][175][176]Support for queued TRIM, aSATA 3.1feature that results in TRIM commands not disrupting the command queues, was introduced in Linux kernel 3.12, released on November 2, 2013.[177]

An alternative to the kernel-level TRIM operation is to use a user-space utility calledfstrimthat goes through all of the unused blocks in a filesystem and dispatches TRIM commands for those areas. Thefstrimutility is usually run bycronorsystemdas a scheduled task. A filesystem that supports TRIM remains required.[178]

Whether formatting or resizing trims the unused space depends on the implementation. For example, themke2fsprogram for formatting ext2/3/4 defaults to issuing a TRIM command (if supported) to the entire block,[179]but theresize2fsprogram for resizing ext2/3/4 does not TRIM the space left unused after shrinking.[180]TRIM-after-resize is instead done byfdiskorsfdisk, programs that edit the partition table.[181]

In addition,bcacheis designed to have an SSD act as a read/write cache for a slower drive such as an HDD.[182]

Versions since Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) support TRIM but only when used with an Apple-purchased SSD.[183]TRIM is not automatically enabled for third-party drives, except for external removable SSDs, although it can be enabled by using third-party utilities such asTrim Enabler. The status of TRIM can be checked in the System Information application or in thesystem_profilercommand-line tool.

Versions since OS X 10.10.4 (Yosemite) includesudo trimforce enableas a Terminal command that enables TRIM on non-Apple SSDs.[184]There is also a technique to enable TRIM in versions earlier than Mac OS X 10.6.8, although it remains uncertain whether TRIM is actually utilized properly in those cases.[185]

Prior to version 7, Microsoft Windows did not take any specific measures to support solid state drives. From Windows 7, the standardNTFS file systemprovides support for the TRIM command.[186]

By default, Windows 7 and newer versions execute TRIM commands automatically if the device is detected to be a solid-state driveandthe filesystem driver supports TRIM (NTFS or ReFS). However, because TRIM irreversibly resets all freed space, it may be desirable to disable support where enabling data recovery is preferred over wear leveling.[187]Windows implements TRIM for more than just file-delete operations. The TRIM operation is integrated with partition- and volume-level commands such asformatanddelete, with file-system commands relating to truncate and compression, and with the System Restore (also known as Volume Snapshot) feature.[188]

Defragmentationshould be disabled on solid-state drives because the location of the file components on an SSD does not significantly impact its performance, but moving the files to make themcontiguoususing theWindows Defragroutine will cause unnecessary write wear on the limited number of write cycles on the SSD. TheSuperFetch featurewill also not materially improve performance and causes additional overhead in the system and SSD.[189]Since Windows 8.1, theWindows Defragroutine would instead "retrim" (TRIM) partitions detected as SSDs.[190]

Windows Vistagenerally expects hard disk drives rather than SSDs.[191][192]Windows VistaincludesReadyBoostto exploit characteristics of USB-connected flash devices, but for SSDs it only improves the default partition alignment to prevent read-modify-write operations that reduce the speed of SSDs. Most SSDs are typically split into 4 KiB sectors, while earlier systems may be based on 512 byte sectors with their default partition setups unaligned to the 4 KiB boundaries.[193]Windows Vista does not send the TRIM command to solid-state drives, but some third-party utilities such as SSD Doctor will periodically scan the drive and TRIM the appropriate entries.[194]

Windows 7 and later versions have native support for SSDs.[188][195]The operating system detects the presence of an SSD and optimizes operation accordingly. For SSD devices, Windows 7 disablesReadyBoostand automatic defragmentation.[196]Despite the initial statement by Steven Sinofsky before the release of Windows 7,[188]however, defragmentation is not disabled, even though its behavior on SSDs differs.[197]One reason is the low performance ofVolume Shadow Copy Serviceon fragmented SSDs.[197]The second reason is to avoid reaching the practical maximum number of file fragments that a volume can handle.[197]

Windows 7 also includes support for the TRIM command to reduce garbage collection for data that the operating system has already determined is no longer valid.[198][199]

Windows 8.1 and later Windows systems also support automatic TRIM for PCI Express SSDs based on NVMe. For Windows 7, the KB2990941 update is required for this functionality and needs to be integrated into Windows Setup using DISM if Windows 7 has to be installed on the NVMe SSD. Windows 8/8.1 also supports the SCSI unmap command, an analog of SATA TRIM, for USB-attached SSDs or SATA-to-USB enclosures. It is also supported overUSB Attached SCSIProtocol (UASP).

Article: Computer cooling

Computer coolingis required to remove thewaste heatproduced bycomputer hardware, to keep components within permissibleoperating temperaturelimits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated includeintegrated circuitssuch ascentral processing units(CPUs),chipsets,graphics cards,hard disk drives, andsolid state drives(SSDs).

Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use ofheatsinkscooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots.Computer fansare widely used along with heatsink fans to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also other cooling techniques, such asliquid cooling. All modern day processors are designed to cut out or reduce their voltage or clock speed if the internal temperature of the processor exceeds a specified limit. This is generally known as Thermal Throttling in the case of reduction of clock speeds, or Thermal Shutdown in the case of a complete shutdown of the device or system.

Cooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer, such as by exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly individually cooled include the CPU,graphics processing unit(GPU) and thenorthbridge.

Integrated circuits(e.g. CPU and GPU) are the main generators of heat in modern computers. Heat generation can be reduced by efficient design and selection of operating parameters such as voltage and frequency, but ultimately, acceptable performance can often only be achieved by managing significant heat generation.

In operation, the temperature of a computer's components will rise until the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal to the heat produced by the component, that is, whenthermal equilibriumis reached. For reliable operation, the temperature must never exceed a specified maximum permissible value unique to each component. For semiconductors, instantaneousjunction temperature, rather than component case, heatsink, or ambient temperature is critical.

Because high temperatures can significantly reduce life span or cause permanent damage to components, and the heat output of components can sometimes exceed the computer's cooling capacity, manufacturers often take additional precautions to ensure that temperatures remain within safe limits. A computer withthermal sensorsintegrated in the CPU, motherboard, chipset, or GPU can shut itself down when high temperatures are detected to prevent permanent damage, although this may not completely guarantee long-term safe operation. Before an overheating component reaches this point, it may be "throttled" until temperatures fall below a safe point usingdynamic frequency scalingtechnology. Throttling reduces the operating frequency and voltage of an integrated circuit or disables non-essential features of the chip to reduce heat output, often at the cost of slightly or significantly reduced performance. For desktop and notebook computers, throttling is often controlled at theBIOSlevel. Throttling is also commonly used to manage temperatures in smartphones and tablets, where components are packed tightly together with little to no active cooling, and with additional heat transferred from the hand of the user.[1]

The user can also perform several tasks in order to preemptively prevent damage from happening. They can perform a visual inspection of the cooler and case fans. If any of them are not spinning correctly, it is likely that they will need to be replaced. The user should also clean the fans thoroughly, since dust and debris can increase the ambient case temperature and impact fan performance. The best way to do so is with compressed air in an open space. Another preemptive technique to prevent damage is to replace the thermal paste regularly.[2]

As electronic computers became larger and more complex, cooling of the active components became a critical factor for reliable operation. Early vacuum-tube computers, with relatively large cabinets, could rely on natural or forced air circulation for cooling. However, solid-state devices were packed much more densely and had lower allowable operating temperatures.

Starting in 1965,IBMand other manufacturers of mainframe computers sponsored intensive research into the physics of cooling densely packed integrated circuits. Many air and liquid cooling systems were devised and investigated, using methods such as natural and forced convection, direct air impingement, direct liquid immersion and forced convection, pool boiling, falling films, flow boiling, and liquid jet impingement. Mathematical analysis was used to predict temperature rises of components for each possible cooling system geometry.[3]

IBM developed three generations of the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) which used a water-cooled cold plate in direct thermal contact with integrated circuit packages. Each package had a thermally conductive pin pressed onto it, and helium gas surrounded chips and heat-conducting pins. The design could remove up to 27 watts from a chip and up to 2000 watts per module, while maintaining chip package temperatures of around 50 °C (122 °F). Systems using TCMs were the3081family (1980),ES/3090(1984) and some models of theES/9000(1990).[3]In the IBM 3081 processor, TCMs allowed up to 2700 watts on a singleprinted circuit boardwhile maintaining chip temperature at 69 °C (156 °F).[4]Thermal conduction modules using water cooling were also used in mainframe systems manufactured by other companies including Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.

TheCray-1supercomputerdesigned in 1976 had a distinctive cooling system. The machine was only 77 inches (2,000 mm) in height and56+1⁄2inches (1,440 mm) in diameter, and consumed up to 115 kilowatts; this is comparable to the average power consumption of a few dozen Western homes or a medium-sized car. The integrated circuits used in the machine were the fastest available at the time, usingemitter-coupled logic; however, the speed was accompanied by high power consumption compared to laterCMOSdevices.

Heat removal was critical.Refrigerantwas circulated through piping embedded in vertical cooling bars in twelve columnar sections of the machine. Each of the 1662 printed circuit modules of the machine had a copper core and was clamped to the cooling bar. The system was designed to maintain the cases of integrated circuits at no more than 54 °C (129 °F), with refrigerant circulating at 21 °C (70 °F). Final heat rejection was through a water-cooled condenser.[5]Piping, heat exchangers, and pumps for the cooling system were arranged in an upholstered bench seat around the outside of the base of the computer. About 20 percent of the machine's weight in operation was refrigerant.[6]

In the later Cray-2, with its more densely packed modules, Seymour Cray had trouble effectively cooling the machine using the metal conduction technique with mechanical refrigeration, so he switched to 'liquid immersion' cooling. This method involved filling the chassis of the Cray-2 with a liquid calledFluorinert. Fluorinert, as its name implies, is an inert liquid that does not interfere with the operation of electronic components. As the components came to operating temperature, the heat would dissipate into the Fluorinert, which was pumped out of the machine to achilled waterheat exchanger.[7]

Performance per wattof modern systems has greatly improved; many more computations can be carried out with a given power consumption than was possible with the integrated circuits of the 1980s and 1990s. Recent supercomputer projects such asBlue Generely on air cooling, which reduces cost, complexity, and size of systems compared to liquid cooling.

Fans are used when natural convection is insufficient to remove heat. Fans may be fitted to thecomputer caseor attached to CPUs, GPUs, chipsets,power supplyunits (PSUs),hard drives, or as cards plugged into an expansion slot. Common fan sizes include 40, 60, 80, 92, 120, and 140 mm. 200, 230, 250 and 300 mm fans are sometimes used in high-performance personal computers.

A computer has a certain resistance to air flowing through the chassis and components. This is the sum of all the smaller impediments to air flow, such as the inlet and outlet openings, air filters, internal chassis, and electronic components. Fans are simple air pumps that provide pressure to the air of the inlet side relative to the output side. That pressure difference moves air through the chassis, with air flowing to areas of lower pressure.

Fans generally have two published specifications: free air flow and maximum differential pressure. Free air flow is the amount of air a fan will move with zero back-pressure. Maximum differential pressure is the amount of pressure a fan can generate when completely blocked. In between these two extremes are a series of corresponding measurements of flow versus pressure which is usually presented as a graph. Each fan model will have a unique curve, like the dashed curves in the adjacent illustration.[8]

Fans can be installed parallel to each other, in series, or a combination of both. Parallel installation would be fans mounted side by side. Series installation would be a second fan in line with another fan such as an inlet fan and an exhaust fan. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed the fans are the same model.

Parallel fans will provide double the free air flow but no additional driving pressure. Series installation, on the other hand, will double the available static pressure but not increase the free air flow rate. The adjacent illustration shows a single fan versus two fans in parallel with a maximum pressure of 0.15 inches (3.8 mm) of water and a doubled flow rate of about 72 cubic feet per minute (2.0 m3/min).

Note that air flow changes as the square root of the pressure. Thus, doubling the pressure will only increase the flow 1.41 (√2) times, not twice as might be assumed. Another way of looking at this is that the pressure must go up by a factor of four to double the flow rate.

To determine flow rate through a chassis, the chassis impedance curve can be measured by imposing an arbitrary pressure at the inlet to the chassis and measuring the flow through the chassis. This requires fairly sophisticated equipment. With the chassis impedance curve (represented by the solid red and black lines on the adjacent curve) determined, the actual flow through the chassis as generated by a particular fan configuration is graphically shown where the chassis impedance curve crosses the fan curve. The slope of the chassis impedance curve is a square root function, where doubling the flow rate required four times the differential pressure.

In this particular example, adding a second fan provided marginal improvement with the flow for both configurations being approximately 27–28 cubic feet per minute (0.76–0.79 m3/min). While not shown on the plot, a second fan in series would provide slightly better performance than the parallel installation.[citation needed]

A simple conservative rule of thumb for cooling flow requirements, discounting such effects as heat loss through the chassis walls and laminar versus turbulent flow, and accounting for the constants for specific heat and density at sea level is:

For example, a typical chassis with 500 watts of load, 130 °F (54 °C) maximum internal temperature in a 100 °F (38 °C) environment, i.e. a difference of 30 °F (17 °C):

This would be actual flow through the chassis and not the free air rating of the fan. It should also be noted that "Q", the heat transferred, is a function of the heat transfer efficiency of a CPU or GPU cooler to the airflow.

A "dual piezo cooling jet", patented byGE, uses vibrations to pump air through the device. The initial device is three millimetres thick and consists of twonickeldiscs that are connected on either side to a sliver of piezoelectric ceramics. An alternating current passed through the ceramic component causes it to expand and contract at up to 150 times per second so that the nickel discs act like a bellows. Contracted, the edges of the discs are pushed apart and suck in hot air. Expanding brings the nickel discs together, expelling the air at high velocity.

The device has no bearings and does not require a motor. It is thinner and consumes less energy than typical fans. The jet can move the same amount of air as a cooling fan twice its size while consuming half as much electricity and at lower cost.[9]

Passiveheatsink cooling involves attaching a block of machined or extruded metal to the part that needs cooling. A thermal adhesive may be used. More commonly for a personal computer CPU, a clamp holds the heatsink directly over the chip, with a thermal grease or thermal pad spread between. This block has fins and ridges to increase its surface area. The heat conductivity of metal is much better than that of air, and it radiates heat better than the component that it is protecting (usually an integrated circuit or CPU).

Dust buildup between the metal fins of a heatsink gradually reduces efficiency, but can be countered with a gas duster by blowing away the dust along with any other unwanted excess material.

Passive heatsinks are commonly found on older CPUs, parts that do not get very hot (such as the chipset), low-power computers, and embedded devices. Many smartphones use only passive cooling.

Usually a heatsink is attached to the integrated heat spreader (IHS), essentially a large, flat plate attached to the CPU, with conduction paste layered between. This dissipates or spreads the heat locally. Unlike a heatsink, a spreader is meant to redistribute heat, not to remove it. In addition, the IHS protects the fragile CPU.

Another growing trend due to the increasing heat density of computers, GPUs, FPGAs, andASICsis to immerse the entire computer or select components in athermally, but not electrically, conductiveliquid. Although rarely used for the cooling of personal computers,[10]liquid immersion is a routine method of cooling large power distribution components such astransformers. It is also becoming popular with data centers.[11][12]Personal computers cooled in this manner may not require either fans or pumps, and may be cooled exclusively bypassive heat exchangebetween the computer hardware and the enclosure it is placed in.[12][13]A heat exchanger (i.e.heater coreor radiator) might still be needed though, and the piping also needs to be placed correctly.[14]

The coolant used must have sufficiently lowelectrical conductivitynot to interfere with the normal operation of the computer. If the liquid is somewhat electrically conductive, it may cause electrical shorts between components or traces and permanently damage them.[15]For these reasons, it is preferred that the liquid be an insulator (dielectric) and not conduct electricity.

A wide variety of liquids exist for this purpose, includingtransformer oils, synthetic single-phase and dual phase dielectric coolants such as3MFluorinertor 3M Novec. Non-purpose oils, including cooking, motor andsilicone oils, have been successfully used for cooling personal computers.

Some fluids used in immersion cooling, especially hydrocarbon based materials such as mineral oils, cooking oils, and organic esters, may degrade some common materials used in computers such as rubbers,polyvinyl chloride(PVC), andthermal greases. Therefore it is critical to review the material compatibility of such fluids prior to use. Mineral oil in particular has been found to have negative effects on PVC and rubber-based wire insulation.[16]Thermal pastes used to transfer heat to heatsinks from processors and graphic cards has been reported to dissolve in some liquids, however with negligible impact to cooling, unless the components were removed and operated in air.[17]

Evaporation, especially for 2-phase coolants, can pose a problem,[18]and the liquid may require either to be regularly refilled or sealed inside the computer's enclosure. Immersion cooling can allow for extremely lowPUEvalues of 1.05, vs air cooling's 1.35, and allow for up to 100 KW of computing power (heat dissipation, TDP) per19-inch rack, as opposed to air cooling, which usually handles up to 23 KW.[19]

Where powerful computers with many features are not required, less powerful computers or ones with fewer features can be used. As of 2011[update]aVIAEPIAmotherboard with CPU typically dissipates approximately 25 watts of heat, whereas a more capable Pentium 4 motherboard and CPU typically dissipates around 140 watts. Computers can be powered withdirect currentfrom an externalpower supplyunit which does not generate heat inside the computer case. The replacement ofcathode-ray-tube(CRT) displays by more efficient thin-screenliquid crystal display(LCD) ones in the early twenty-first century has reduced power consumption significantly.

A component may be fitted in good thermal contact with a heatsink, a passive device with large thermal capacity and with a large surface area relative to its volume. Heatsinks are usually made of a metal with highthermal conductivitysuch as aluminium or copper,[20]and incorporate fins to increase surface area. Heat from a relatively small component is transferred to the larger heatsink; the equilibrium temperature of the component plus heatsink is much lower than the component's alone would be. Heat is carried away from the heatsink by convective or fan-forced airflow. Fan cooling is often used to cool processors and graphics cards that consume significant amounts of electrical energy. In a computer, a typical heat-generating component may be manufactured with a flat surface. A block of metal with a corresponding flat surface and finned construction, sometimes with an attached fan, is clamped to the component. To fill poorly conducting air gaps due to imperfectly flat and smooth surfaces, a thin layer ofthermal grease, athermal pad, orthermal adhesivemay be placed between the component and heatsink.

Heat is removed from the heatsink byconvection, to some extent byradiation, and possibly byconductionif the heatsink is in thermal contact with, say, the metal case. Inexpensive fan-cooledaluminiumheatsinks are often used on standard desktop computers. Heatsinks withcopperbase-plates, or made of copper, have better thermal characteristics than those made of aluminium. A copper heatsink is more effective than an aluminium unit of the same size, which is relevant with regard to the high-power-consumption components used in high-performance computers.

Passive heatsinks are commonly found on older CPUs, parts that do not dissipate much power (such as the chipset), computers with low-power processors, and equipment where silent operation is critical and fan noise unacceptable.

Usually a heatsink is clamped to the integrated heat spreader (IHS), a flat metal plate the size of the CPU package which is part of the CPU assembly and spreads the heat locally. A thin layer of thermal compound is placed between them to compensate for surface imperfections. The spreader's primary purpose is to redistribute heat. The heatsink fins improve its efficiency.

Several brands of DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM memory modules are fitted with a finned heatsink clipped onto the top edge of the module. The same technique is used for video cards that use a finned passive heatsink on the GPU.

Higher-end M.2 SSDs can be prone to significant heat generation, and as a result these may be sold with a heatsink included, or alternatively a third-party heatsink may be attached by the user during installation.

Fan-cooled aluminium heatsinks were originally the norm for desktop computers, but nowadays many heatsinks feature copper base-plate, copper base-circle, or are entirely made of copper.

Dust tends to build up in the crevices of finned heatsinks, particularly with the high airflow produced by fans. This keeps the air away from the hot component, reducing cooling effectiveness; however, removing the dust restores effectiveness.

Peltier junctions are generally only around 10–15% as efficient as the idealrefrigerator(Carnot cycle), compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems (reverseRankinesystems using compression/expansion).[21]Due to this lower efficiency, thermoelectric cooling is generally only used in environments where the solid state nature (nomoving parts, low maintenance, compact size, and orientation insensitivity) outweighs pure efficiency.

Modern TECs use several stacked units each composed of dozens or hundreds of thermocouples laid out next to each other, which allows for a substantial amount ofheat transfer. A combination ofbismuthandtelluriumis most commonly used for the thermocouples.

As active heat pumps which consume power, TECs can produce temperatures below ambient, impossible with passive heatsinks, radiator-cooledliquid cooling, and heatpipe HSFs. However, while pumping heat, a Peltier module will typically consume more electric power than the heat amount being pumped.

It is also possible to use a Peltier element together with a high pressure refrigerant (two phase cooling) to cool the CPU.[22][23]

Liquid cooling is a highly effective method of removing excess heat, with the most commonheat transfer fluidin desktop PCs being (distilled) water. The advantages of water cooling overair coolinginclude water's higherspecific heat capacityandthermal conductivity.

The principle used in a typical (active) liquid cooling system for computers is identical to that used in an automobile'sinternal combustion engine, with the water being circulated by a water pump through a water block mounted on the CPU (and sometimes additional components as GPU and northbridge)[24]and out to aheat exchanger, typically aradiator. The radiator is itself usually cooled additionally by means of afan.[24]Besides a fan, it could possibly also be cooled by other means, such as a Peltier cooler (although Peltier elements are most commonly placed directly on top of the hardware to be cooled, and the coolant is used to conduct the heat away from the hot side of the Peltier element).[25][26]A coolant reservoir is often also connected to the system.[27]

Besides active liquid cooling systems, passive liquid cooling systems are also sometimes used.[28][29][30][31][32]These systems often leave out a fan or a water pump, theoretically increasing their reliability and making them quieter than active systems. The downsides of these systems are that they are much less efficient in discarding the heat and thus need   much more coolant—and a commensurately larger reservoir— to give it time to cool down.

Liquids allow the transfer of more heat from the parts being cooled than air, making liquid cooling suitable for overclocking and high performance computer applications.[33]Compared to air cooling, liquid cooling is also influenced less by the ambient temperature.[34]Liquid cooling's comparatively low noise level compares favorably to that of air cooling, which can become quite noisy.

Disadvantages of liquid cooling include complexity and the potential for a coolant leak. Leaking water (and any additives in the water) can damage electronic components with which it comes into contact, and the need to test for and repair leaks makes for more complex and less reliable installations.[35](The first major foray into the field of liquid-cooled personal computers for general use, the high-end versions ofApple'sPower Mac G5, was ultimately doomed by a propensity for coolant leaks.[36]) An air-cooled heatsink is generally much simpler to build, install, and maintain than a water cooling solution,[37]although CPU-specific water cooling kits can also be found, which may be just as easy to install as an air cooler. These are not limited to CPUs, and liquid cooling of GPU cards is also possible.[38]

While originally limited tomainframecomputers, liquid cooling has become a practice largely associated withoverclockingin the form of either manufactured all-in-one (AIO) kits or do-it-yourself setups assembled from individually gathered parts.[39]The past few years[when?]have seen an increase in the popularity of liquid cooling in pre-assembled, moderate to high performance, desktop computers. Sealed ("closed-loop") systems incorporating a small pre-filled radiator, fan, and waterblock simplify the installation and maintenance of water cooling at a slight cost in cooling effectiveness relative to larger and more complex setups. Liquid cooling is typically combined with air cooling, using liquid cooling for the hottest components, such as CPUs or GPUs, while retaining the simpler and cheaper air cooling for less demanding components.

The IBMAquasarsystem useshot water coolingto achieveenergy efficiency, the water being used to heat buildings as well.[40][41]

Since 2011, the effectiveness of water cooling has prompted a series of all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions.[42]AIO solutions result in a much simpler to install the unit, and most units have been reviewed positively by review sites.

A heat pipe is a hollow tube containing a heat transfer liquid. The liquid absorbs heat and evaporates at one end of the pipe. The vapor travels to the other (cooler) end of the tube, where it condenses, giving up itslatent heat. The liquid returns to the hot end of the tube by gravity orcapillary actionand repeats the cycle. Heat pipes have a much higher effective thermal conductivity than solid materials. For use in computers, the heatsink on the CPU is attached to a larger radiator heatsink. Both heatsinks are hollow, as is the attachment between them, creating one large heat pipe that transfers heat from the CPU to the radiator, which is then cooled using some conventional method. This method is usually used when space is tight, as in small form-factor PCs and laptops, or where no fan noise can be tolerated, as in audio production. Because of the efficiency of this method of cooling, many desktop CPUs and GPUs, as well as high end chipsets, use heat pipes or vapor chambers in addition to active fan-based cooling and passive heatsinks to remain within safe operating temperatures. A vapor chamber operates on the same principles as a heat pipe but takes on the form of a slab or sheet instead of a pipe. Heat pipes may be placed vertically on top and form part of vapor chambers. Vapor chambers may also be used on high-endsmartphones.

The cooling technology under development by Kronos and Thorn Micro Technologies employs a device called an ionic wind pump (also known as an electrostatic fluid accelerator). The basic operating principle of an ionic wind pump iscorona discharge, an electrical discharge near a charged conductor caused by the ionization of the surrounding air.

The corona discharge cooler developed by Kronos works in the following manner: A high electric field is created at the tip of the cathode, which is placed on one side of the CPU. The high energy potential causes the oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the air to become ionized (positively charged) and create a corona (a halo of charged particles). Placing a grounded anode at the opposite end of the CPU causes the charged ions in the corona to accelerate towards the anode, colliding with neutral air molecules on the way. During these collisions, momentum is transferred from the ionized gas to the neutral air molecules, resulting in movement of gas towards the anode.

The advantages of the corona-based cooler are its lack of moving parts, thereby eliminating certain reliability issues and operating with a near-zero noise level and moderate energy consumption.[43]

Soft cooling is the practice of utilizing software to take advantage ofCPU power saving technologiesto minimize energy use. This is done usinghaltinstructions to turn off or put in standby state CPU subparts that aren't being used or byunderclockingthe CPU. While resulting in lower total speeds, this can be very useful if overclocking a CPU to improveuser experiencerather than increase raw processing power, since it can prevent the need for noisier cooling. Contrary to what the term suggests, it is not a form of cooling but of reducing heat creation.

Undervoltingis a practice of running the CPU or any other component with voltages below the device specifications. An undervolted component draws less power and thus produces less heat. The ability to do this varies by manufacturer, product line, and even different production runs of the same product (as well as that of other components in the system), but processors are often specified to use voltages higher than strictly necessary. Thistoleranceensures that the processor will have a higher chance of performing correctly under sub-optimal conditions, such as a lower-quality motherboard or low power supply voltages. Below a certain limit, the processor will not function correctly, although undervolting too far does not typically lead to permanent hardware damage (unlike overvolting).

Undervolting is used forquiet systems, as less cooling is needed because of the reduction of heat production, allowing noisy fans to be omitted. It is also used when battery charge life must be maximized.

Conventional cooling techniques all attach their "cooling" component to the outside of the computer chip package. This "attaching" technique will always exhibit some thermal resistance, reducing its effectiveness. The heat can be more efficiently and quickly removed by directly cooling the local hot spots of the chip, within the package. At these locations, power dissipation of over 300 W/cm2(typical CPU is less than 100 W/cm2) can occur, although future systems are expected to exceed 1000 W/cm2.[44]This form of local cooling is essential to developing high power density chips. This ideology has led to the investigation of integrating cooling elements into the computer chip. Currently there are two techniques: micro-channel heatsinks, and jet impingement cooling.

In micro-channel heatsinks, channels are fabricated into the silicon chip (CPU), and coolant is pumped through them. The channels are designed with very large surface area which results in large heat transfers. Heat dissipation of 3000 W/cm2has been reported with this technique.[45]The heat dissipation can be further increased if two-phase flow cooling is applied. Unfortunately, the system requires large pressure drops, due to the small channels, and theheat fluxis lower with dielectric coolants used in electronic cooling.

Another local chip cooling technique is jet impingement cooling. In this technique, a coolant is flowed through a small orifice to form a jet. The jet is directed toward the surface of the CPU chip, and can effectively remove large heat fluxes. Heat dissipation of over 1000 W/cm2has been reported.[46]The system can be operated at lower pressure in comparison to the micro-channel method. The heat transfer can be further increased using two-phase flow cooling and by integrating return flow channels (hybrid between micro-channel heatsinks and jet impingement cooling).

Phase-change cooling is an extremely effective way to cool the processor. A vapor compression phase-change cooler is a unit that usually sits underneath the PC, with a tube leading to the processor. Inside the unit is a compressor of the same type as in anair conditioner. The compressor compresses a gas (or mixture of gases) which comes from the evaporator (CPU cooler discussed below). Then, the very hot high-pressure vapor is pushed into the condenser (heat dissipation device) where it condenses from a hot gas into a liquid, typically subcooled at the exit of the condenser then the liquid is fed to an expansion device (restriction in the system) to cause a drop in pressure a vaporize the fluid (cause it to reach a pressure where it can boil at the desired temperature); the expansion device used can be a simple capillary tube to a more elaborate thermal expansion valve. The liquid evaporates (changing phase), absorbing the heat from the processor as it draws extra energy from its environment to accommodate this change (seelatent heat). The evaporation can produce temperatures reaching around −15 to −150 °C (5 to −238 °F). The liquid flows into the evaporator cooling the CPU, turning into a vapor at low pressure. At the end of the evaporator this gas flows down to the compressor and the cycle begins over again. This way, the processor can be cooled to temperatures ranging from −15 to −150 °C (5 to −238 °F), depending on the load, wattage of the processor, the refrigeration system (seerefrigeration) and the gas mixture used. This type of system suffers from a number of issues (cost, weight, size, vibration, maintenance, cost of electricity, noise, need for a specialized computer tower) but, mainly, one must be concerned with dew point and the proper insulation of all sub-ambient surfaces that must be done (the pipes will sweat, dripping water on sensitive electronics).

Alternately, a new breed of the cooling system is being developed, inserting a pump into thethermosiphonloop. This adds another degree of flexibility for the design engineer, as the heat can now be effectively transported away from the heat source and either reclaimed or dissipated to ambient. Junction temperature can be tuned by adjusting the system pressure; higher pressure equals higher fluid saturation temperatures. This allows for smaller condensers, smaller fans, and/or the effective dissipation of heat in a high ambient temperature environment. These systems are, in essence, the next generation fluid cooling paradigm, as they are approximately 10 times more efficient than single-phase water. Since the system uses a dielectric as the heat transport medium, leaks do not cause a catastrophic failure of the electric system.

This type of cooling is seen as a more extreme way to cool components since the units are relatively expensive compared to the average desktop. They also generate a significant amount of noise, since they are essentially refrigerators; however, the compressor choice and air cooling system is the main determinant of this, allowing for flexibility for noise reduction based on the parts chosen.

A "thermosiphon" traditionally refers to a closed system consisting of several pipes and/or chambers, with a larger chamber containing a small reservoir of liquid (often having a boiling point just above ambient temperature, but not necessarily). The larger chamber is as close to the heat source and designed to conduct as much heat from it into the liquid as possible, for example, a CPU cold plate with the chamber inside it filled with the liquid. One or more pipes extend upward into some sort of radiator or similar heat dissipation area, and this is all set up such that the CPU heats the reservoir and liquid it contains, which begins boiling, and the vapor travels up the tube(s) into the radiator/heat dissipation area, and then after condensing, drips back down into the reservoir, or runs down the sides of the tube. This requires no moving parts, and is somewhat similar to a heat pump, except that capillary action is not used, making it potentially better in some sense (perhaps most importantly, better in that it is much easier to build, and much more customizable for specific use cases and the flow of coolant/vapor can be arranged in a much wider variety of positions and distances, and have far greater thermal mass and maximum capacity compared to heat pipes which are limited by the amount of coolant present and the speed and flow rate of coolant that capillary action can achieve with the wicking used, often sintered copper powder on the walls of the tube, which have a limited flow rate and capacity.)

Asliquid nitrogenboils at −196 °C (−320.8 °F), far below the freezing point of water, it is valuable as an extreme coolant for short overclocking sessions.

In a typical installation of liquid nitrogen cooling, a copper or aluminium pipe is mounted on top of the processor or graphics card. After the system has been heavily insulated against condensation, the liquid nitrogen is poured into the pipe, resulting in temperatures well below −100 °C (−148 °F).

Evaporation devices ranging from cut out heatsinks with pipes attached to custom milled copper containers are used to hold the nitrogen as well as to prevent large temperature changes. However, after the nitrogen evaporates, it has to be refilled. In the realm of personal computers, this method of cooling is seldom used in contexts other thanoverclockingtrial-runs and record-setting attempts, as the CPU will usually expire within a relatively short period of time due to temperaturestresscaused by changes in internal temperature.

Although liquid nitrogen is non-flammable, it can condenseoxygendirectly from air. Mixtures ofliquid oxygenand flammable materials can bedangerously explosive.

Liquid nitrogen cooling is, generally, only used for processor benchmarking, due to the fact that continuous usage may cause permanent damage to one or more parts of the computer and, if handled in a careless way, can even harm the user, causingfrostbite.

Liquid helium, colder than liquid nitrogen, has also been used for cooling. Liquid helium boils at −269 °C (−452.20 °F), and temperatures ranging from −230 to −240 °C (−382.0 to −400.0 °F) have been measured from the heatsink.[47]However, liquid helium is more expensive and more difficult to store and use than liquid nitrogen. Also, extremely low temperatures can cause integrated circuits to stop functioning. Silicon-based semiconductors, for example, will freeze out at around −233 °C (−387.4 °F).[48]

Commonly known asbongor boiler cooling, due to the outward appearance. Water is atomized and blown through a heatsink with a fan. The mist increases the surface area of water, which cools the water itself. Ice can be added for lower temperatures.[49][50]

Cooling can be improved by several techniques, which may involve additional expense or effort. These techniques are often used, in particular, by those who run parts of their computer (such as the CPU and GPU) at higher voltages and frequencies than specified by the manufacturer (overclocking), which increases heat generation.

The installation of higher-performance, non-stock cooling may also be consideredmodding. Many overclockers simply buy more efficient, and often, more expensive fan and heatsink combinations, while others resort to more exotic ways of computer cooling, such as liquid cooling, Peltier effect heatpumps, heat pipe or phase change cooling.

Perfectly flat surfaces in contact give optimal cooling, but perfect flatness and absence of microscopic air gaps is not practically possible, particularly inmass-producedequipment. A very thin skim ofthermal compound, which is much more thermally conductive than air, though much less so than metal, can improve thermal contact and cooling by filling in the air gaps. If only a small amount of compound just sufficient to fill the gaps is used, the best temperature reduction will be obtained.

There is much debate about the merits of compounds, and overclockers often consider some compounds to be superior to others. The main consideration is to use the minimal amount of thermal compound required to even out surfaces, as the thermal conductivity of compound is typically 1/3 to 1/400 that of metal, though much better than air. The conductivity of the heatsink compound ranges from about 0.5 to 80W/mK[52](see articles); that of aluminium is about 200, that of air about 0.02.Heat-conductive padsare also used, often fitted by manufacturers to heatsinks. They are less effective than properly applied thermal compound, but simpler to apply and, if fixed to the heatsink, cannot be omitted by users unaware of the importance of good thermal contact, or replaced by a thick and ineffective layer of compound.

Unlike some techniques discussed here, the use of thermal compound or padding is almost universal when dissipating significant amounts of heat.

Mass-produced CPU heat spreaders and heatsink bases are never perfectly flat or smooth; if these surfaces are placed in the best contact possible, there will be air gaps which reduce heat conduction. This can easily be mitigated by the use of thermal compound, but for the best possible results surfaces must be as flat as possible. This can be achieved by a laborious process known aslapping, which can reduce CPU temperature by typically 2 °C (4 °F).[53]

Most older PCs use flatribbon cablesto connect storage drives (IDEorSCSI). These large flat cables greatly impede airflow by causing drag and turbulence. Overclockers and modders often replace these with rounded cables, with the conductive wires bunched together tightly to reduce surface area. Theoretically, the parallel strands of conductors in a ribbon cable serve to reducecrosstalk(signal carrying conductors inducing signals in nearby conductors), but there is no empirical evidence of rounding cables reducing performance. This may be because the length of the cable is short enough so that the effect of crosstalk is negligible. Problems usually arise when the cable is notelectromagnetically protectedand the length is considerable, a more frequent occurrence with older network cables.

These computer cables can then be cable tied to the chassis or other cables to further increase airflow.

The colder the cooling medium (the air), the more effective thecooling. Cooling air temperature can be improved with these guidelines:

Fewer fans strategically placed will improve the airflow internally within the PC and thus lower the overall internal case temperature in relation to ambient conditions. The use of larger fans also improves efficiency and lowers the amount of waste heat along with the amount of noise generated by the fans while in operation.

There is little agreement on the effectiveness of different fan placement configurations, and little in the way of systematic testing has been done. For a rectangular PC (ATX) case, a fan in the front with a fan in the rear and one in the top has been found to be a suitable configuration. However, AMD's (somewhat outdated) system cooling guidelines notes that "A front cooling fan does not seem to be essential. In fact, in some extreme situations, testing showed these fans to be recirculating hot air rather than introducing cool air."[54]It may be that fans in the side panels could have a similar detrimental effect – possibly through disrupting the normal air flow through the case. However, this is unconfirmed and probably varies with the configuration.

Loosely speaking, positive pressure means intake into the case is stronger than exhaust from the case. This configuration results in pressure inside of the case being higher than in its environment. Negative pressure means exhaust is stronger than intake. This results in internal air pressure being lower than in the environment. Both configurations have benefits and drawbacks, with positive pressure being the more popular of the two configurations. Negative pressure results in the case pulling air through holes and vents separate from the fans, as the internal gases will attempt to reach an equilibrium pressure with the environment. Consequently, this results in dust entering the computer in all locations. Positive pressure in combination with filtered intake solves this issue, as air will only incline to be exhausted through these holes and vents in order to reach an equilibrium with its environment. Dust is then unable to enter the case except through the intake fans, which need to possess dust filters.

Desktop computerstypically use one or more fans for cooling. While almost all desktop power supplies have at least one built-in fan, power supplies should never draw heated air from within the case, as this results in higher PSU operating temperatures which decrease the PSU's energy efficiency, reliability and overall ability to provide a steady supply of power to the computer's internal components. For this reason, all modern ATX cases (with some exceptions found in ultra-low-budget cases) feature a power supply mount in the bottom, with a dedicated PSU air intake (often with its own filter) beneath the mounting location, allowing the PSU to draw cool air from beneath the case.

Most manufacturers recommend bringing cool, fresh air in at the bottom front of the case, and exhausting warm air from the top rear[citation needed]. If fans are fitted to force air into the case more effectively than it is removed, the pressure inside becomes higher than outside, referred to as a "positive" airflow (the opposite case is called "negative" airflow). Worth noting is that positive internal pressure only prevents dust accumulating in the case if the air intakes are equipped with dust filters.[55]A case with negative internal pressure will suffer a higher rate of dust accumulation even if the intakes are filtered, as the negative pressure will draw dust in through any available opening in the case

Amotherboard, also called amainboard, asystem board, alogic board, and informally amobo(see"Nomenclature" section), is the mainprinted circuit board(PCB) ingeneral-purpose computersand other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as thecentral processing unit(CPU) andmemory, and provides connectors for otherperipherals.

Unlike abackplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the CPU, thechipset'sinput/outputandmemory controllers,interfaceconnectors, and other components integrated for general use.[1]: 48

Oxford English Dictionarytraces the origin of the wordmotherboardto 1965, its earliest-found attestation occurring in the magazineElectronics.[2]The term alludes to its importance and size compared to the components attached to it, being the "mother of all boards" in a computer system.[3]

Several alternative terms formotherboardhave been used in technical documentation and industry practice, includingmainboard,system board,logic board,baseboard, and the informalmobo. These terms are functionally synonymous and reflect regional, corporate, or contextual preferences rather than a coordinated effort to adopt gender-neutral language.[citation needed]

System boardwas used byIBMin documentation for theIBM PCand its derivatives; however, higher-end models in thePS/2line, such as theModel 80, used the termplanarinstead.Applecommonly useslogic boardin its technical documentation for products such as theApple IIand theMac.Inteltypically usesbaseboardin its technical manuals, though it also usesmotherboardinterchangeably.[1]The termmobois an informal truncation ofmotherboard, popularized by computer enthusiasts and builders in the 1990s.[4]

The termmainboardsometimes describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards inlaser printers,televisionsets,washing machines,mobile phones, and otherembedded systemswith limited expansion abilities.[citation needed]

Before the advent of themicroprocessor, thecentral processing unit(CPU) of acomputerwas typically implemented using multipleprinted circuit boardshoused in a card cage, interconnected via abackplane—a board containing sockets into which the individual circuit boards were inserted. Early systems used discrete copper wiring between connector pins, but printed circuit boards quickly became the standard. The CPU,main memory, andperipheralcomponents were each located on separate boards connected through the backplane.

With the rise of microprocessors, CPU functionality and supporting circuitry were consolidated onto a single board, while memory and peripherals remained on separate expansion cards plugged into the backplane. A prominent example is theS-100 bus, widely used in 1970s microcomputer systems such as theAltair 8800.

In the 1980s, popular personal computers like theApple IIandIBM Personal Computerfeatured publicly available schematic diagrams and technical documentation[5][6]. This openness enabled rapidreverse engineeringand the development of third-party motherboards. These clone and upgrade boards often provided enhanced performance or additional features, and were commonly used to modernize or replace original manufacturer hardware.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also calledSuper I/Ochips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals:PS/2keyboardandmouse,floppy disk drive,serial ports, andparallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for anyexpansion cardsat all; higher-end systems for3Dgaming andcomputer graphicstypically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components.

Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century (like thetablet computerand thenetbook). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some systems.

A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains thecentral processing unitand hosts other subsystems and devices.

A typicaldesktop computerhas itsmicroprocessor,main memory, and other essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such asexternal storage, controllers forvideodisplay andsound, and peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or via cables; in modern microcomputers, it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself.

An important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor's supportingchipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the variousbusesand external components. This chipset determines, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.

Additionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such asUSBformouse devicesandkeyboards. Earlypersonal computerssuch as theApple IIandIBM PCinclude only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Video interface hardware was also occasionally integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II. It was even less common on IBM-compatible computers, such as theIBM PCjr. Additional peripherals such asdisk controllersandserial portswere provided as expansion cards.

Given the highthermal design powerof high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always includeheat sinksand mounting points forfansto dissipate excess heat.

Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes calledform factors, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit variouscasesizes. As of 2024[update], mostdesktop computermotherboards use theATXstandard form factor — even those found inMacintoshandSuncomputers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case's motherboard andpower supply unit(PSU) form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate amicroATXmotherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized, and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard.

ACPU socket(central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component that attaches to aprinted circuit board(PCB) and is designed to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop andserver computers(laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on theIntel x86architecture. A CPU socket type and the motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.

With the steadily declining costs and size ofintegrated circuits, it is now possible to include support for manyperipheralson the motherboard. By combining many functions on onePCB, the physical size and total cost of the system may be reduced; highly-integrated motherboards are thus especially popular insmall form factorand budget computers. Theintegrated peripheralsmay also be calledonboard devices.

A typical motherboard will have a different number of slots, depending on its standard andform factor.

A standard, modern ATX motherboard will typically have two or threePCI-Expressx16 slots for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion cards, and one or two PCI-E x1 (which has supersededPCI). A standardEATXmotherboard will have two to four PCI-E x16 slots for graphics cards, and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E x1 slots. It can sometimes also have a PCI-E x4 slot (although this will vary between brands and models).

Many motherboards feature two or morePCI Express(PCIe) x16 slots, enabling support for multiple graphics cards or connecting multiple monitors directly without requiring specialized hardware. Some high-end models support multi-GPU technologies such asNvidia'sScalable Link Interface(SLI) andAMD'sCrossFire(formerly ATI CrossFire), which allow two to four graphics cards to operate in parallel, improving performance in graphics-intensive applications like gaming and video editing. However, as modern games and APIs increasingly favor single powerful GPUs, and with both Nvidia and AMD having largely discontinued active support for these technologies, multi-GPU configurations are now less common.

Modern motherboards typically include one or moreM.2slots—some high-end models offer up to four. These slots support a variety of devices, includingNVMe-basedsolid-state drives(SSDs),SATA-based M.2 SSDs, andwireless network interface controllers(such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules). M.2 provides a compact, high-speed interface that leverages the PCIe or SATA bus, depending on the configuration.

Motherboards are generallyair cooled, withheat sinksoften mounted on larger chips in modern motherboards.[10]Insufficient or improper cooling can cause damage to the internal components of the computer, or even cause it tocrash.Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on thepower supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPUs until the late 1990s; since then, most have requiredCPU fansmounted onheat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additionalcomputer fansand integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures and controllable fan connectors which theBIOSoroperating systemcan use to regulate fan speed.[11]Alternatively, computers can use awater coolingsystem instead of many fans.

Somesmall form factorcomputers andhome theater PCsdesigned for quiet and energy-efficient operation boast fan-less designs. This typically requires the use of a low-power CPU, as well as a careful layout of the motherboard and othercomponentsto allow for heat sink placement.

A 2003 study found that some spurious computer crashes and general reliability issues, ranging from screen image distortions toI/Oread/write errors, can be attributed not tosoftwareor peripheralhardwarebut to agingcapacitorson PC motherboards.[12]Ultimately, this was shown to be the result of a faulty electrolyte formulation,[13]an issue termedcapacitor plague.

Modern motherboards useelectrolytic capacitorsto filter theDCpower distributed around the board. These capacitors age at a temperature-dependent rate, as their water basedelectrolytesslowly evaporate. This can lead to loss of capacitance and subsequent motherboard malfunctions due tovoltageinstabilities. While most capacitors are rated for 2000 hours of operation at 105 °C (221 °F),[14]their expected design life roughly doubles for every 10 °C (18 °F) below this. At 65 °C (149 °F) a lifetime of 3 to 4 years can be expected. However, many manufacturers deliver substandard capacitors,[15]which significantly reduce life expectancy. Inadequate case cooling and elevated temperatures around the CPU socket exacerbate this problem. With top blowers, the motherboard components can be kept under 95 °C (203 °F), effectively doubling the motherboard lifetime.

Mid-range and high-end motherboards, on the other hand, usesolid capacitorsexclusively. For every 10 °C less, their average lifespan is multiplied approximately by three, resulting in a 6-times higher lifetime expectancy at 65 °C (149 °F).[16]These capacitors may be rated for 5000, 10000 or 12000 hours of operation at 105 °C (221 °F), extending the projected lifetime in comparison with standard solid capacitors.

In desktop PCs and notebook computers, the motherboard cooling and monitoring solutions are usually based on asuper I/Ochip or anembedded controller.

Modern motherboards contain firmware stored in non-volatile memory such asROM,EPROM,EEPROM, orNOR flash, which is responsible for initializing system hardware and loading anoperating systemfrom aboot device. The termsbootingandbootstrappingderive from the metaphor "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps", reflecting the self-starting nature of the process.[17]

In early microcomputers like theApple IIandIBM Personal Computer, firmware was stored in socketedROMchips on the motherboard. Upon power-up, thecentral processing unit(CPU) would load itsprogram counterwith the address of the boot ROM and begin executing instructions from it. These instructions performed apower-on self-test(POST), initialized hardware components, displayed system information, verifiedrandom-access memory(RAM), and attempted to locate and load an operating system from a bootable peripheral device. If no such device was found, the system would either execute built-in software from ROM—such asCassette BASIC(commonly known as ROM BASIC)—or display an error message, depending on the model. For instance, both the Apple II and the original IBM PC would launch their built-in BASIC interpreter when no bootable disk was present.

The boot firmware in modernIBM PC compatiblemotherboard designs contains either aBIOS, as did the boot ROM on the original IBM PC, orUEFI. UEFI is a successor to BIOS that became popular after Microsoft began requiring it for a system to be certified to runWindows 8.[18][19]

When the computer is powered on, the boot firmware tests and configures memory, circuitry, and peripherals. ThisPower-On Self Test(POST) may include testing some of the following things:

InRISCprocessor based embedded systems, the simpler boot firmware, such asDas U-Boot, may be used on the motherboard.

Apower supply unit(PSU) convertsmains ACto low-voltage regulatedDC powerfor the internal components of adesktop computer. Modern personal computers universally useswitched-mode power supplies. Somepower supplieshave a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the main voltage.

Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to theATX specification, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5-voltstandby (5VSB) power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered. ATX power supplies are turned on and off by a signal from themotherboard. They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages are in spec, so that the computer is able to safely power up and boot. The most recent ATX PSU standard is version 3.1 as of mid 2025.[1]

The desktop computer power supply converts thealternating current(AC) from awall socketofmains electricityto a low-voltagedirect current(DC) to operate the motherboard, processor and peripheral devices. Several direct-current voltages are required, and they must be regulated with some accuracy to provide stable operation of the computer. Apower supply railorvoltage railrefers to a single voltage provided by a PSU.[2]

Some PSUs can also supply astandby voltage, so that most of thecomputersystem can be powered off after preparing for hibernation or shutdown, and powered back on by an event. Standby power allows a computer to be started remotely viawake-on-LANandWake-on-ringor locally via Keyboard Power ON (KBPO) if the motherboard supports it. This standby voltage may be generated by a small linear power supply inside the unit or a switching power supply, sharing some components with the main unit to save cost and energy.

First-generationmicrocomputerandhome computerpower supply units used a heavy step-downtransformerand a linear power supply, as used, in for example, theCommodore PETintroduced in 1977. TheApple II, also introduced in 1977, was noted for itsswitched-mode power supply, which was lighter and smaller than an equivalent linear power supply would have been, and which had no cooling fan.  The switched-mode supply uses aferrite-coredhigh frequencytransformer and power transistors that switch thousands of times per second. By adjusting the switching time of the transistor, the output voltage can be closely controlled without dissipating energy as heat in a linear regulator. The development of high-power and high-voltage transistors at economical prices made it practical to introduce switched-mode supplies that had been used in aerospace, mainframes, minicomputers and color television, into desktop personal computers. TheApple IIdesign byAtariengineerRod Holtwas awarded a patent,[3][4]and was in the vanguard of modern computer power supply design. Now all modern computers use switched-mode power supplies, which are lighter, less costly, and more efficient than equivalent linear power supplies.

Computer power supplies may have short circuit protection, overpower (overload) protection, over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, over-current protection, and over-temperature protection.

Power supplies designed for worldwide use were once equipped with an input voltage selector switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid. In the lower voltage range, around 115 V, this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler inDelon circuitdesign. As a result, the large primaryfilter capacitorbehind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series, balanced withbleeder resistorsandvaristorsthat were necessary in the upper input voltage range, around 230 V. Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher-voltage grid usually resulted in immediate permanent damage. When apower-factor correction(PFC) was required, those filter capacitors were replaced with higher-capacity ones, together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current. This is the simple design of a passive PFC.

Active PFC is more complex and can achieve higher PF, up to 99%. The first active PFC circuits just delayed the inrush. Newer ones work as an input and output condition-controlled step-up converter, supplying a single 400 V filter capacitor from a wide-range input source, usually between 80 and 240 V. Newer PFC circuits also replace theNTC-based inrush current limiter, which is an expensive part previously located next to the fuse.

The firstIBM PCpower supply unit (PSU) supplied two main voltages: +5Vand +12 V. It supplied two other voltages, −5 V and −12 V, but with limited amounts of power. Mostmicrochipsof the time operated on 5 V power. Of the 63.5Wthese PSUs could deliver, most of it was on this +5 V rail.

The +12 V supply was used primarily to operate motors such as in disk drives and cooling fans. As more peripherals were added, more power was delivered on the 12 V rail. However, since most of the power is consumed by chips, the 5 V rail still delivered most of the power. The −12 V rail was used primarily to provide the negative supply voltage to theRS-232serial ports. A −5 V rail was provided for peripherals on the ISA bus (such as soundcards), but was not used by any motherboard other than the original IBM PC motherboard.

An additional wire referred to as 'Power Good' is used to prevent digital circuitry operation during the initial milliseconds of power supply turn-on, where output voltages and currents are rising but not yet sufficient or stable for proper device operation. Once the output power is ready to use, the Power Good signal tells the digital circuitry that it can begin to operate.

Original IBM power supplies for the PC (model 5150),XTandATincluded a line-voltage power switch that extended through the side of the computer case. In a common variant found intowercases, the line-voltage switch was connected to the power supply with a short cable, allowing it to be mounted apart from the power supply.

An early microcomputer power supply was either fully on or off, controlled by the mechanical line-voltage switch, and energy saving low-power idle modes were not a design consideration of early computer power supplies. These power supplies were generally not capable of power saving modes such as standby or "soft off", or scheduled turn-on power controls.

Due to the always-on design, in the event of ashort circuit, either a fuse would blow, or a switched-mode supply would repeatedly cut the power, wait a brief period of time, and attempt to restart. For some power supplies the repeated restarting is audible as a quiet rapid chirping or ticking emitted from the device.

WhenInteldeveloped theATXstandard power supply connector (published in 1995), microchips operating on 3.3 V were becoming more popular, beginning with theIntel 80486DX4microprocessor in 1994, and the ATX standard supplies three positive rails: +3.3 V, +5 V, and +12 V. Earlier computers requiring 3.3 V typically derived that from a simple but inefficientlinear regulatorconnected to the +5 V rail.

The ATX connector provides multiple wires and power connections for the 3.3 V supply, because it is most sensitive tovoltage dropin the supply connections. Another ATX addition was the +5 V SB (standby) rail for providing a small amount ofstandby power, even when the computer was nominally "off".

There are two basic differences betweenATand ATX power supplies: the connectors that provide power to the motherboard, and the soft switch. In ATX-style systems, the front-panel power switch provides only a control signal to the power supply and does not switch the mains AC voltage. This low-voltage control allows othercomputer hardwareorsoftwareto turn the system on and off.

Since ATX power supplies share both the same dimensions (150 × 86 mm (5.9 × 3.4 in)) and the same mounting layout (four screws arranged on the back side of the unit), with the prior format, there is no major physical difference preventing an AT case from accepting an ATX PSU (or vice versa, if the case can host the power switch needed by an AT PSU), provided that the specific PSU is not too long for the specific case.

As transistors become smaller on chips, it becomes preferable to operate them on lower supply voltages, and the lowest supply voltage is often desired by the densest chip, thecentral processing unit. In order to supply large amounts of low-voltage power to thePentiumand subsequent microprocessors, a special power supply, thevoltage regulator modulebegan to be included onmotherboards. Newer processors may require over 200 A at 1.5 V or less, which is impractical to deliver from off-board power supplies.

Initially, this was supplied by the main +5 V supply, but as power demands increased, the high currents required to supply sufficient power became problematic. To reduce the power losses in the 5 V supply, with the introduction of thePentium 4microprocessor, Intel changed the processor power supply to operate on +12 V, and added the separate four-pinP4 connectorto the new ATX12V 1.0 standard to supply that power.

Modern high-poweredgraphics processing unitsdo the same thing, resulting in most of the power requirement of a modern personal computer being on the +12 V rail. When high-powered GPUs were first introduced, typical ATX power supplies were "5 V-heavy", and could only supply 50–60% of their output in the form of 12 V power. Thus, GPU manufacturers, to ensure 200–250 W of 12 V power (peak load, CPU+GPU), recommended power supplies of 500–600 W or higher. More modern ATX power supplies can deliver almost all (typically 80–90%) of their total rated capacity in the form of +12 V power.

Because of this change, it is important to consider the +12 V supply capacity, rather than the overall power capacity, when using an older ATX power supply with a more recent computer.

Low-quality power supply manufacturers sometimes take advantage of this overspecification by assigning unrealistically high power supply ratings, knowing that very few customers fully understand power supply ratings.[5]

+3.3 V and +5 V rail voltage supplies are rarely a limiting factor; generally, any supply with a sufficient +12 V rating will have adequate capacity at lower voltages.[citation needed]However, most hard drives orPCI cardswill create a greater load on the +5 V rail[citation needed].

Older[when?]CPUs andlogic deviceson the motherboard were designed for 5 V operating voltage. Power supplies for those computers regulate the 5 V output precisely, and supply the 12 V rail in a specified voltage window depending on the load ratio of both rails. The +12 V supply was used forcomputer fanmotors, disk drive motors and serial interfaces (which also used the −12 V supply). A further use of the 12 V came with the sound cards, using linear chipaudio power amplifiers, sometimes filtered by a 9 Vlinear regulatoron the card to cut thenoiseof the motors.

Since certaini386variant CPUs use lower operating voltages such as 3.3 or 3.45 V,[citation needed]motherboards had linear voltage regulators supplied by the 5 V rail. Jumpers or dip switches set the output voltages to the installed CPU's specification. When newer CPUs required higher currents, switching mode voltage regulators likebuck convertersreplaced linear regulators for efficiency.

Since the first revision of theATXstandard, PSUs were required to have a 3.3 V output voltage rail. Rarely, a linear regulator generated these, supplied from the 5 V and converting the product of voltage drop and current to heat. Later[when?]regulators managed all the 3.3, 5 and 12 V rails.

As CPUs increased in current consumption (due to higher static current due to higher transistor count and much higher dynamic current due to both higher count and switching frequency) in CPU generations after thei386, it became necessary to place voltage regulators close to the CPU. In order to reduce power consumption of regulation (and thus to remain thermally feasible), these regulators are ofswitch-mode power supplydesign[citation needed]. To keep conduction losses at bay, it is desirable to transport the same power on the higher-voltage +12 V rail at lower current, instead of on +5V at higher current. Thus, Pentium-era power supplies tend have their highest current capacity on these rails.

Entry-Level Power Supply Specification(EPS) is a power supply unit meant for high-power-consumption computers and entry-level servers. Developed by theServer System Infrastructure(SSI) forum, a group of companies including Intel, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others, that works on server standards, the EPS form factor is a derivative of theATXform factor. The latest specification is v2.93.

The EPS standard provides a more powerful and stable environment for critical server-based systems and applications. EPS power supplies have a 24-pin motherboard power connector and an eight-pin +12 V connector. The standard also specifies two additional four-pin 12 V connectors for more power-hungry boards (one required on 700–800 W PSUs, both required on 850 W+ PSUs). EPS power supplies are in principle compatible with standardATXorATX12Vmotherboards found in homes and offices but there may be mechanical issues where the 12 V connector and in the case of older boards connector overhang the sockets.[6]Many PSU vendors use connectors where the extra sections can be unclipped to avoid this issue. As with later versions of the ATX PSU standard, there is also no −5 V rail.

As power supply capacity increased, the ATX power supply standard was amended (beginning with version 2.0[7]) to include:

3.2.4. Power Limit / Hazardous Energy LevelsUnder normal or overload conditions, no output shall continuously provide more than 240 VA under any conditions of load including output short circuit, per the requirement of UL 1950 / CSA 950 / EN 60950 / IEC 950.

The requirement was later deleted from version 2.3 (March 2007) of the ATX12V power supply specifications,[9]but led to a distinction in modern ATX power supplies between single and multiple rails.

The rule was intended to set a safe limit on thecurrentable to pass through any single output wire. A sufficiently large current can cause serious damage in the event of ashort circuit, or canmelt the wire or its insulationin the case of a fault, or potentiallystart a fireor damage other components. The rule limits each output to below 20amps, with typical supplies guaranteeing 18 A availability. Power supplies capable of delivering more than 18 A at 12 V would provide their output in groups of cables (called "rails"). Each rail delivers up to a limited amount of current through one or more cables, and each rail is independently controlled by its own current sensor which shuts down the supply upon excess current. Unlike afuseorcircuit breaker, these limits reset as soon as the overload is removed. Typically, a power supply will guarantee at least 17 A at 12 V by having a current limit of18.5 A ± 8%. Thus, it is guaranteed to supply at least 17 A, and guaranteed to cut off before 20 A. The current limits for each group of cables is then documented so the user can avoid placing too many high-current loads in the same group.

Originally at the time of ATX 2.0, a power supply featuring "multiple +12 V rails" implied one able to deliver more than 20 A of +12 V power, and was seen as a good thing. However, people found the need tobalance loadsacross many +12 V rails inconvenient, especially as higher-end PSUs began to deliver far greater currents up to around 2000 W, or more than 150 A at 12 V (compared to the 240 or 500 W of earlier times). When the assignment of connectors to rails is done at manufacturing time it is not always possible to move a given load to a different rail or manage the allocation of current across devices.

Rather than add more current limit circuits, many manufacturers chose to ignore the requirement and increase the current limits above 20 A per rail, or provided "single-rail" power supplies that omit the current limit circuitry. (In some cases, in violation of their own advertising claims to include it.[10]) Because of the above standards, almost all high-power supplies claimed to implement separate rails, however this claim was often false; many omitted the necessary current-limit circuitry,[11]both for cost reasons and because it is an irritation to customers.[12](The lack was, and is, sometimes advertised as a feature under names like "rail fusion" or "current sharing".)

The requirement was withdrawn as a result, however, the issue left its mark on PSU designs, which can be categorized into single rail and multiple rail designs. Both may (and often do) contain current limiting controllers. As of ATX 2.31, a single rail design's output current can be drawn through any combination of output cables, and the management and safe allocation of that load is left for the user. A multiple rail design does the same, but limits the current supplied to each individual connector (or group of connectors), and the limits it imposes are the manufacturer's choice rather than set by the ATX standard.

Since 2011, Fujitsu and other tier-1 manufacturers[13]have been manufacturing systems containing motherboard variants that require only a 12 V supply from a custom-made PSU, which is typically rated at 250–300 W.DC-to-DC conversion, providing 5 V and 3.3 V, is done on the motherboard usingvoltage regulator modules.[14]Google has shared that it's been using 12 V-only PSUs in its server fleet since around 2003.[14]The proposal is that 5 V and 12 V supply for other devices, such as HDDs, will be picked up at the motherboard rather than from the PSU itself, although this does not appear to be fully implemented as of January 2012[update].

The reasons given for this approach to power supply are that it eliminates cross-load problems, simplifies and reduces internal wiring that can affect airflow and cooling, reduces costs, increases power supply efficiency, and reduces noise by bringing the power supply fan speed under the control of the motherboard.

At least two of Dell's business PCs introduced in 2013, theOptiPlex9020 andPrecisionT1700, ship with 12 V–only power supplies and implement 5 V and 3.3 V conversion exclusively on the motherboard. Afterwards, LenovoThinkCentreM93P adopted 12 V–only PSU and performs 5 V and 3.3 V conversion exclusively on the IS8XM motherboard.

In 2019, Intel released a new standard based on an all-12V design: ATX12VO. The power supply only provides 12 V voltage output;[15]5 V, 3.3 V powers, as needed byUSB,hard disk driveand other devices, are transformed on themotherboard; and the ATX motherboard connector is reduced from 24-pin to 10-pin. Called ATX12VO, it is not expected to replace current standards but to exist alongside it.[16]AtCES2020,FSP Groupshowed the first prototype based on the new ATX12VO standard.

According to the Single Rail Power Supply ATX12VO design guide officially published by Intel in May 2020, the guide listed the details of 12V-only design and the major benefit which included higher efficiency and lower electrical interruption.[17]

The overall power draw on a PSU is limited by the fact that all of the supply rails come through onetransformerand any of its primary side circuitry, likeswitchingcomponents. Total power requirements for a personal computer may range from 250 W to more than 1000 W for a high-performance computer with multiple graphics cards. Personal computers without especially high performing CPUs or graphics cards for the 2000s usually require 300 to 500 W.[12]

Power supplies are designed around 40% greater than the calculatedsystem power consumption. This protects against system performance degradation, and against power supply overloading. Power supplies label their totalratedpoweroutput, and label how this is determined by theelectric currentlimits for each of the voltages supplied. Some power supplies have no overload protection, though current ATX and ATX12VO power specifications both require one to be present.

The system power consumption is a sum of the power ratings for all of the components of the computer system that draw on the power supply. Some graphics cards (especially multiple cards) and large groups of hard drives can place very heavy demands on the 12 V lines of the PSU, and for these loads, the PSU's 12 V rating is crucial. The total 12 V rating on the power supply must be higher than the current required by such devices so that the PSU can fully serve the system when its other 12 V system components are taken into account. The manufacturers of these computer system components, especially graphics cards, tend to over-rate their power requirements, to minimize support issues due to too low of a power supply.

For CPUs and GPUs, the most readily accessible power rating is thethermal design power(TDP). However, the TDP reflects a value used in thermal design, where aheat sinkis present to smooth out any peak in heat emission, but thecapacitorspresent in a PSU is far from having similar smoothing ability.[18]As a result, a PSU that theoretically fits the sum of TDPs may still trigger its overload protection (over-current protection, OCP and over-power protection, OPP) on high loads, causing a system reboot or shutdown.[19]

A very common example of spiky power draw is in frame-limited gaming, where each frame is associated with a spike in CPU, then GPU, power draw. This issue is lessened on gaming consoles as the peaks of CPU and GPU power draw can be made to not overlap through scheduling. Current PCs do not have this feature.[19]

The peak power draw of a 2010s CPU is often quoted at 1.5× its TDP.[18]The use of "dynamic overclocking" features such asIntel Turbo Boosthave caused some ambiguity in the meaning of TDP, but additional power limit settings such as PL2 (Intel) and PPT/TDC (AMD) remain accessible for obtaining a better estimate of the true thermal power limit; with PL4 and EDC available for the true peak power limit.[19]

GPUs show even more dramatic power consumption spikes: an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super with 215 W TDP generates peak draws of 430 W in frame-limited gaming. Furthermore, the two major GPU vendors (Nvidia and AMD) do not provide peak power draw data to end-users, even though Nvidia is known to have "Input EDP Peak" information in their internal specifications. Instead, the manufacturers would provide an opaque "PSU recommendation" for each GPU model, a rating that includes a whole hypothetical system. Peak power becomes only accessible to end users through third-party measurements, which require high-speed ocsilloscopes and current probes.[19][20]

Although this issue can be solved by purchasing higher-rated PSUs that satisfy the peak power draw, a better solution is to design the PSU to tolerate this spiky load by avoiding oversensitive OCP and OPP, a direction most 2020 PSUs err in.[19]For 2018 PSUs, it appears that peaks under 2 milliseconds can largely be ignored.[21]As of 2019, the amount of excess capacity from protection circuits is not yet standardized or reported on consumer PSUs and third-party reviews are required for now.[22]Server power supply standards such as CRPS do define the minimum amount of excess capacity.[23]

Since ATX 3.0 (2022), there is a basic requirement for the PSU to handlepower excursion(short-term peak loads that exceed the stated maximum (sustained) permitted power) on the PCIe power connectors, due an add-on Engineering Change Notice (ECN) to PCIe CEM 5.0. For the external connectors, an ATX 3.0 PSU must be able to handle a 100-microsecond power draw at 3× of maximum sustained power, decreasing to 1× at the 1-second window. A broader change has been incorporated into PCIe CEM 5.1 for all add-in card power connectors, which is used by ATX 3.1. This change also defines power excursion for PCIe slot power at 2.5× over 100 μs.[24]

The +12V power may be divided into several independent rails, marked +12V1, +12V2, +12V3, +12V4, etc. Each rail may become independently overloaded.

When there are two rails that share power through down-regulating, it also happens that either the 12 V rail or the 5 V rail overloadsat well below the total ratingof the power supply. Many power supplies create their 3.3 V output by down-regulating their 5 V rail, or create 5 V output by down-regulating their 12 V rails. The two rails involved are labeled on the power supply with a combined current limit. For example, the5Vand3.3Vrails are rated with a combined total current limit. For a description of the potential problem, a 3.3 V rail may have a 10 A rating by itself (33W), and the 5 V rail may have a20Arating (100W) by itself, but the two together may only be able to output 110 W. In this case, loading the 3.3 V rail to maximum (33 W), would leave the 5 V rail only able to output 77 W.

A power supply that is self-certified by its manufacturer may claim output ratings double or more than what is actually provided.[25][26]

Various initiatives exist to improve the efficiency of computer power supplies.Climate Savers Computing Initiativepromotes energy saving and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging development and use of more efficient power supplies.80 Pluscertifies a variety of efficiency levels for power supplies and encourages their use via financial incentives. Efficient power supplies also save money by wasting less power; as a result, they use less electricity to power the same computer, and they emit less waste heat which results significant energy savings on central air conditioning in the summer. The gains of using an efficient power supply are more substantial in computers that use a lot of power.

Although a power supply with a larger than needed power rating will have an extra margin of safety against overloading, such a unit is often less efficient and wastes more electricity at lower loads than a more appropriately sized unit. For example, a 900-watt power supply with the80 Plus Silverefficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 85% efficient for loads above 180 W) may only be 73% efficient when the load is lower than 100 W, which is a typical idle power for a desktop computer. Thus, for a 100 W load, losses for this supply would be 27 W; if the same power supply was put under a 450 W load, for which the supply's efficiency peaks at 89%, the loss would be only 56 W despite supplying 4.5 times the useful power.[27][28]For a comparison, a 500-watt power supply carrying the80 Plus Bronzeefficiency rating (which means that such a power supply is designed to be at least 82% efficient for loads above 100 W) may provide an 84% efficiency for a 100 W load, wasting only 19 W.[29]Other ratings such as 80 Plus Gold, 80 Plus Platinum and 80 Plus Titanium also provide the same ratings respectively. 80 Plus Gold provides an 87% efficiency under 100% load, 80 Plus Platinum provides a 90% efficiency and 80 Plus Titanium provides the best efficiency of 94% at 50% load at 115 V and 95.4% at 50% load at 230 V.[1][30][31]

A test in 2005 revealed computer power supplies are generally about 70–80% efficient.[32]For a 75% efficient power supply to produce 75 W of DC output it would require 100 W of AC input and dissipate the remaining 25 W in heat. Higher-quality power supplies can be over 80% efficient; as a result, energy-efficient PSUs waste less energy in heat and require less airflow to cool, resulting in quieter operation.

As of 2012 some high-end consumer PSUs can exceed 90% efficiency at optimal load levels, though will fall to 87–89% efficiency during heavy or light loads. Google's server power supplies are more than 90% efficient.[14]HP's server power supplies have reached 94% efficiency.[33]Standard PSUs sold for server workstations have around 90% efficiency, as of 2010.

The energy efficiency of a power supply drops significantly at low loads. Therefore, it is important to match the capacity of a power supply to the power needs of the computer. Efficiency generally peaks at about 50–75% load. The curve varies from model to model (examples of how this curve looks can be seen on test reports of energy-efficient models found on the80 PluswebsiteArchived2010-08-28 at theWayback Machine).

Most desktop personal computer power supplies are a square metal box, and have a large bundle of wires emerging from one end. Opposite the wire bundle is the back face of the power supply, with an air vent and anIEC 60320 C14connector to supply AC power. There may be a power switch and/or a voltage selector switch. Historically they were mounted on the upper part of the computer case, and had two fans: one, inside the case, pulling air towards the power supply, and another, extracting air from the power supply to the outside. Many power supplies have a single large fan inside the case, and are mounted on the bottom part of the case. The fan may be always on, or turn on and vary its speed depending on the load. Some have no fans, hence are cooled passively.[37][38][39]

A label on one side of the box lists technical information about the power supply, including safety certifications and maximum output power. Commoncertification marksfor safety are theUL mark,GS mark,TÜV,NEMKO,SEMKO, DEMKO, FIMKO,CCC,CSA,VDE,GOST Rmark and BSMI. Common certificate marks forEMI/RFIare theCE mark,FCCand C-tick. The CE mark is required for power supplies sold in Europe and India. ARoHSor80 Pluscan also sometimes be seen.

Dimensions of an ATX power supply are 150 mm width, 86 mm height, and typically 140 mm depth, although the depth can vary from brand to brand.

Some power supplies come with sleeved cables, which besides being more aesthetically pleasing, also make wiring easier and have a less detrimental effect on airflow.

Typically, power supplies have the following connectors (all areMolex(USA) Inc Mini-Fit Jr, unless otherwise indicated):

These connectors are used to supply extra power toPCI Express(PCIe) cards for which thepower available from a PCIe slotis insufficient. Typically, they're used by PCIegraphics cards. Higher-power cards may have sockets for multiple connectors.

A modular power supply provides a detachable cable system, offering the ability to remove unused connections at the expense of a small amount of extra electrical resistance introduced by the additional connector.[74]This reduces clutter, removes the risk of dangling cables interfering with other components, and can improve case airflow.  Many semi modular supplies have some permanent multi-wire cables with connectors at the ends, such as ATX motherboard and 8-pinEPS, though newer supplies marketed as "fully modular" allow even these to be disconnected.  The pin assignment of the detachable cables is only standardized on the output end and not on the end that is to be connected to the power supply.  Thus, the cables of a modular power supply must only be used with this particular modular power supply model.  Usage with another modular power supply, even if the cable prima facie appear compatible, might result in a wrong pin assignment and thus can lead to damage of connected components by supplying 12V to a 5V or 3.3V pin.[75]

The Small Form Factor with a 12 V connector (SFX12V) configuration has been optimized forsmall form factor(SFF) system layouts such asmicroATX. The low profile of the power supply fits easily into these systems. The SFX-L configuration is a minor variation of SFX12V that solely increases the allowed depth by 30% (to 1 cm shallower than the maximum of regular ATX12V).[36]

The Thin Form Factor with a 12 V connector (TFX12V) configuration has been optimized for small and low profileMini ITXandMini DTXsystem layouts. The long narrow profile of the power supply fits easily into low profile systems. The cooling fan placement can be used to efficiently exhaust air from the processor and core area of the motherboard, making possible smaller, more efficient systems using common industry components.[76]

Most portable computers have power supplies that provide 25 to 200 W. In portable computers (such aslaptops) there is usually an external power supply (sometimes referred to as a "power brick" due to its similarity, in size, shape and weight, to a realbrick) which converts AC power to one DC voltage (most commonly 19 V), and furtherDC-DC conversionoccurs within the laptop to supply the various DC voltages required by the other components of the portable computer.

External power supply could send data about itself (power, current and voltage ratings) to the computer. For example, genuineDellpower source uses1-Wireprotocol to send data by third wire to thelaptop. The laptop then refuses a non-matching adapter.[78]

Rack mountservers may utilize redundant power supply based onedge connector("slot") connections that allow them to be inserted or removed without shutting down the system. Most systems use two PSUs fed from two different sources of external power. The two PSUs may share the load, or one may stay in standby leaving the other to generate most of the DC power.

There used to be no standard for redundant PSUs, with manufacturers each specifying their own standard, e.g. the Common Slot Power Supply (CSPS) used by Hewlett-Packard and Huawei servers. Some time before 2012,[79]Intel defined a Common Redundant Power Supply (CRPS) standard and shared it with other PSU and server hardware manufacturers. Intel later contributed this standard to the Open Compute Project as the Modular Hardware System - Common Redundant Power Supply (M-CRPS) base specification, first publicly released in 2022 as version 0.70, under aCC BYlicense.[23]

PSUs compliant with M-CRPS version 1.05.00 RC5 are backwards compatible with systems using "Legacy CRPS".[23]"Legacy CRPS" PSUs cannot be inserted into M-CRPS systems due to physical keying (no forward compatibility). They would be compatible if not for (1) different voltage set-points interfering with load balancing (2) overly "strong" pull-up resistors on A0 and A1 pins.[80]

Life span is usually specified inmean time between failures(MTBF), where higher MTBF ratings indicate longer device life and better reliability. Using higher qualityelectrical componentsat less than their maximum ratings or providing better cooling can contribute to a higher MTBF rating because lower stress and lower operating temperatures decrease component failure rates.[81]

An estimated MTBF value of 100,000 hours (roughly, 140 months) at 25 °C and under full load is fairly common.[82]Such a rating expects that, under the described conditions, 77% of the PSUs will be operating failure-free over three years (36 months); equivalently, 23% of the units are expected to fail within three years of operation. For the same example, only 37% of the units (fewer than a half) are expected to last 100,000 hours without failing.[a]The formula for calculating predictedreliability,R(t), is

wheretis the time of operation in the same time units as the MTBF specification,eisthe mathematical constantapproximately equal to 2.71828, andtMTBFis the MTBF value as specified by a manufacturer.[83][84]

Power supplies for servers, industrial control equipment, or other places where reliability is important may behot swappable, and may incorporateN+1 redundancyanduninterruptible power supply; ifNpower supplies are required to meet the load requirement, one extra is installed to provideredundancyand allow for a faulty power supply to be replaced without downtimes.[85]

A 'power supply tester' is a tool used to test the functionality of a computer's power supply. Testers can confirm the presence of the correct voltages at each power supply connector. Testing under load is recommended for the most accurate readings.[88]

The voltage of the PSU can be monitored by thesystem monitorof most modern motherboards.[90]This can often be done through a section within theBIOS, or, once anoperating systemis running, through asystem monitorsoftware likelm_sensorsonLinux,envstatonNetBSD, sysctlhw.sensorsonOpenBSDandDragonFly BSD, orSpeedFanon Windows.

Most power supply fans are not connected to the speed sensor on the motherboard and so cannot be monitored, but some high-end PSUs can provide digital control and monitoring, which requires a connection to the fan-speed sensor or USB port on the motherboard.

Title: Is pairing a 7800X3D with a 4070 Super a bottleneck or a good match

Question/Post: I’m finishing a new build and stuck on the CPU/GPU combo.  
I already bought a 4070 Super but I’m debating between a 5800X3D (cheaper + fits my current AM4 board) or jumping to 7800X3D and upgrading motherboard + RAM.  
I mainly play competitive titles (Val, Apex, League) and a few heavier games like RDR2.  
Is the performance jump from 5800X3D to 7800X3D worth the extra cost in real world gaming or is it mostly benchmark flexing? Trying to decide if I should save the money or future proof now.

Title: CPU stuck to motherboard and will not come off

Question/Post: My first time building, finished the build and powered on but CPU led came on. Everything was plugged in and tested both ram slots. Took off cooler and was going to reseat the CPU but it will NOT come off. Feels like it's glued to the motherboard, moves up and down slightly but that's it. Is it stuck/broken?? Everything I've googled has cpu's stuck to the cooler or latch but none that are stuck to the socket itself. Thanks!

https://imgur.com/a/QEhqwOy

EDIT: Added the imgur photo

EDIT 2: Apparently I put my shit in backwards, how did I do this? No idea. Is this fixable or should I just go buy another mobo 

EDIT 3: Got cpu off mobo,  miraculously both seemed fine. Took it in to a store and they said it seemed OK. Put it in PROPERLY and it posted. Now time to put it all back together and see what happens

Title: RAM arrived opened. Return it?

Question/Post: Got my RAM today and while the delivery package was sealed, the actual box was open and the product packing was just weird overall.

https://imgur.com/a/HrD54Ac

Should I return it? RAM costs more than a CPU nowadays, if it breaks, I’m cooked for at least a year.

EDIT: I decided to return it for a full refund. I bought it relatively recently so I'm only losing 50 bucks due to rising prices and about 10 days. Really blows, but it is what it is, my peace of mind was more important. That's it for me for Corsair, I think. Thanks for all the feedback.

Question/Post: Original PC: Lenovo M75s-1 w/ Ryzen 7 3700 

"New" PC: Dell Desktop w/ i7 9700

I assumed the i7 9700 would outperform the Ryzen 7 3700 based off of benchmarks I've seen. 

The i7 9700 performing 50% slower in Cinibench R23 single/multi core tests and running at a much higher load in game.

I'm seeing a lot of mixed information. 

Is this to be expected?

Title: Is it safe to leave my CPU computing for a week while I'm on vacation maintaining around 95% load with temperatures between 78 - 85C for a week?

Question/Post: [https://imgur.com/a/Qx0ybSa](https://imgur.com/a/Qx0ybSa)

I'm going for holiday soon, and I have some deep-learning quantitative research going on and I need my R7 5800X3D to run 24/7 for at least a week to go through millions of data combinations and processes, from my testing, it averages what I mentioned in the title, I could find online that it's generally OKAY as long as your CPU is below 100C, but would it be damaged or its life shortened if it remains under around 95% load for lengthy time periods?

I could go the extra mile and keep windows open during winter, so it should help at least with room temperature dropping, I could also place a fan next to the window to keep the air moving.

Title: Why is the RTX5060 not good? 2060S user

Question/Post: Hi, I just bought a second hand PC for 300 euro with an RTX2060S and i7-10700.  I recently put a 1tb 870 evo, upgraded the cooling because it didn't have any and bought a new 1080p 300hz monitor (TCL 25G64).

I saw an offer for an RTX3070TI for 300 euro on Facebook marketplace and it seems a good upgrade from a 2060S but I'm currently playing 2018 games that I bought when they were cheap and I didn't have a PC.  I am a playstation 4 and 5 user mainly and this is my first gaming PC after years being interested, so I'm used to 60fps as a good experience.

My 2060S runs Fortnite on high with a stable 80fps, fh4 on 120fps and ac origins max with a stable 90fps.

So anyways, why is the 5060 not seen as good for 1080 despite being much newer? Are PC players more demanding than playstation players in their hardware and 60fps not seen as good?

Basically a vague post but I'm not sure why the 5060 isn't seen as good but I'm satisfied with the 2060 performance which is much worse.

Title: What is worse? A cheap UPS, or no UPS?

Question/Post: So I have a new PC (my build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LRNC3w) that I want to properly protect from power flickers (resulting from voltage drops) and brownouts, because apparently a regular surge protector doesn't do anything against those (it's in the name). I get like 10-15 of those a year. I currently just use a regular power strip, not even a surge protector. 

Although these flickers never really damaged my old PC, but I don't want to keep rolling that dice on my new one.

So I wanted to get a UPS. Specifically, of the "line-interactive" type. An "offline/standby" UPS doesn't really do anything in this regard, and an "online/double conversion" UPS is not only expensive and noisy, it is way overkill. Online UPS's are primarily used by enterprise IT folks where 100% uptime and stability is mandatory, never really by the average home PC user.

But there are a *ton* of conflicting info on UPS's. Trust me, I've looked into like 50 Reddit posts at this point. I guess electricity is complicated, huh? People will be like "noooo you must buy this $600 unit from X brand or your stuff is toast!".

I just want to buy the cheapest one possible that matches the specs that I need. I was thinking of buying the [CP1500PFCLCD (amazon link)](https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500PFCLCD-Sinewave-Outlets-Mini-Tower/dp/B00429N19W?th=1), which has plenty of wattage, a good sine wave (people also debate endlessly whether this actually does anything or not), and is from a popular brand.

People will be like "uh, CyberPower sucks" or like "$240? That thing will catch on fire". Also apparently, before COVID hit in 2020, something like this would've cost like $120, so that is something to take into account when looking at older discussions or discussing with people with older knowledge. It's true that it's one of the cheaper brands, but is this thing better than *not* having a UPS? 

Thanks

Title: No longer able to access bios

Question/Post: I just relaced parts in my pc including a new motherboard. I had trouble booting my pc into windows but i changed the botting method from UEFI to CMS in the bios. Then my pc started windows and i thought it was fine, however when i turn it off and start it i can no longer access bios whatever i do. I have tried 2 different screens, hdmi and DP in both the GPU and motherboard. Im trying to access the bios to make PCIe the primary display.  
What is also weird is that i can only get a display on my screen if i boot my pc with the DP in my motherboard, there is no display if i boot it with the DP in my GPU. However, i will still have a display if i move the DP from my motherboard to my GPU after it has already booted up.  
Im so confused and no clue what to do from here, if anyone knows plas lmk.

Question/Post: I'm on the process of upgrade my PC.
Currently I'm looking to get a new motherboard and CPU and comes the question, intel or AMD.
It's to pair up with a rtx 5070 ti. Psu is 850w 80 + gold.
Case I will upgrade to a nzxt h7 flow with arctic water cooling.
Budget for CPU will be around 250-300€.

So far I've been looking to get a gigabyte motherboard, the b760 gaming X ddr4 + i5-14600kf.
Main purpose gaming and work. Mostly gaming.
Upgrading to RAM ddr5 is out of the question for now since the prices... Well everyone knows.

Title: R7 5800X with 5070 Ti: Bottleneck? (I'm sorry)

Question/Post: Apologies for the despised "is this a bottle neck?" post, I'll keep it short:

I'm running a 5800X (non-3D). Upgrading platforms is obviously not viable for now.

I'm getting a 5070Ti and I run 1440p 180hz. Would there be a tangible bottleneck with this combination? I only ask as the 5800X is getting a tad old.

Title: Is this a damaged PCIE slot?

Question/Post: I recently built a brand new first PC. 5090 FE, Asus Rog Strix b850i mobo, 9800x3D and 64gb DDR5, 4TB LEXAR Gen 4 NVME.

When benchmarking I noticed performance for all benchmarks was well below the bell curve on 3DMark.

I ensured via GPU-Z and manually toggling bios to use Gen 4 PCIE speeds.

The biggest concern was the PCIE Bandwidth Benchmark which showed bandwidth of only 5gb/s. Which is absurdly low.

I ensured all drivers were up to date, updated BIOS, reinstalled windows…etc.

HW-Info also shows lots of PCIE Bus Errors.

I reseated my GPU twice and this time when taking it apart took photos of my PCIE slot on the mobo. Is this damaged? Would this kind of damage result in the benchmark gaps I listed. The system seems stable besides this.

Pcie slot images — https://imgur.com/a/CF6qoGw

Hwinfo — https://imgur.com/a/O4nnucd

For what it’s worth I can run games, they just run at lower FPS then what I should be getting on a 5090. (Approx half).

Gpu-z also shows its running @ 16 x 4.0 which is what I have it set to. I’m surprised that if the slot is damaged its even running this well at all.

Title: Controller recommendations

Question/Post: I am looking to buy a new controller for my partner for Christmas. He currently uses his xbox controller and connects it via USB, so I'd like something that is wireless. I know nothing about controllers or PCs and need all the advice I can get. He is a fairly casual gamer, some games he like to play are HellDivers, God of War, and Spiderman on his PC. He also played xbox frequently, but I would like a controller that is only for the PC. Budget is around $100 and I'd love for it to look cool as well, not just plain black

Title: is it worth upgrading from 3070 ti to 3080?

Question/Post: the rtx 3080 costs around 370$
i will sell my gpu which is gigabyte rtx 3070 ti gaming OC for 260-290$
i mainly play 1440p competitive games and my main concern is the temps difference from the 3070 ti to 3080
the one i MIGHT upgrade to is either MSI ventus 3x OR gigabyte 3x
I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

Edit 1 I think I will go for the rtx 5070 since the  price difference between 3080 and 5070 is not that big the difference is only 130$

Title: Build help

Question/Post: Hi guys,
I’m planning to upgrade to a new PC next year because my current setup just isn’t keeping up anymore. I game a lot, mainly competitive titles, but I also edit in After Effects and Photoshop, and I’m hoping to get into Blender as well.

I mostly play FPS games like BO7, CS, and Battlefield, but I’m also not a stranger to story and cinematic titles, so I’d love a build that can handle both ends of the spectrum. I don’t have a strict budget yet, but if I had to name one, it would be around 4K AUD. I game more than I edit, although that might just be because my PC struggles with rendering and makes me avoid it.

I’ve got a basic understanding of PC components, but I definitely need help figuring out what’s ideal for my needs. I already have all my peripherals, and the only thing I’m considering changing is my monitors since I want to move away from ultrawide. I only use one for gaming and the second just so I don’t have to constantly alt tab, so recommendations are welcome.

Also, sorry in advance, but I really like Lian Li fans, so I’d love to include some if the budget allows. I’d prefer an AIO over air cooling, and ideally an NVIDIA card, but performance comes first so I’m flexible.

Thank you!

Title: Is it worth upgrading from a 24" FHD to a 27" QHD monitor, for someone that dislikes big screens and wants high pixel density?

Question/Post: I’m considering moving from my current Asus VP249QGR (24" 1080p 144hz) display to a 27" 1440p monitor, but I’m not sure if the upgrade makes sense for my use case. Ideally I'd get a 24" 1440p but there's absolutely none in my country, and importing one is a very expensive and complicated process. Also there's not many on the market to begin with. I'm going to be pairing this with a R7-7700 and a RTX 3080 Ti. I’d appreciate opinions from people who’ve made a similar jump. Here's my concerns:

* Pixel density: The PPI increase from 24" 1080p (91 ppi) to 27" 1440p (108 ppi) is mediocre. Not sure how noticeable it will be in day-to-day use or gaming. My previous screen was a 21.5" 1080p had 102 ppi and while it was crisper than my current one it wasn't all that amazing either.

* Performance hit: I will definitely lose some FPS at 1440p, approximately 20-25% from what I've seen in benchmarks. I’m wondering if the visual improvement is worth the performance penalty. This performance penalty will mean using more upscaling to reach the same frames, will 1440p DLSS look better than native 1080p?

* Ergonomics: My desk is small-ish (60cm deep), which means I sit relatively close to the monitor. Not sure if 27" will feel too large at short viewing distances. I liked my 21.5" better than my current 24" in this regard. If I could find a high quality, high refresh 22" 1080p I would definitely buy that, but they're all basic office monitors in that size.

Another option would be buying a 2160p 27" for some juicy ppi increase (163ppi) but that would mean even greater performance losses (around 50% or in some cases even more) and would make DLSS balanced (or even performance) mandatory. Also they costs twice as much as 27" 1440p screens, and I'm already reaching my budget limit after my latest PSU and GPU upgrade. On the other hand, I'm futureproofing my monitor for the forseeable future.

Title: 4 ram sticks no longer posting

Question/Post: * Ryzen 5700X3D
* 2 Corsair Vengeance LPX (2x8gb) Kits (Micron, Hynix) 3000mhz cl16
* X570 Aorus Elite Bios F40

I previously was able to get this setup to POST with XMP, but after reseating my cpu cooler to apply paste, I can no longer boot. I cannot boot 4 sticks at base speeds either.

However, 3 sticks will boot fine, and also at XMP. I've tried pushing the DRAM voltage to 1.4V and VSoC Uncore to 1.2V, but 4 sticks won't accept it. I've also verified that all sticks will work as single stick and dual stick configs, and that all slots are still working.

Is there anything else I can do to try and get this to POST?

Title: First UE5 dev PC build (Canada) - did I overspec this? Need help cutting costs.

Question/Post: Hi everyone,

I’m trying to build a PC primarily for **Unreal Engine 5 development**. This is my first time speccing out a build, so I’m still learning what actually matters. I’d like something that will last a few years for serious dev work, but I’m on a budget and this ended up way more expensive than I expected.

I’m in **Canada**, using **ca.pcpartpicker**, and these are **CAD** prices.

Here’s what I have right now:

&gt;**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7900X 4.7 GHz 12-Core – **$439.98**  
**CPU Cooler:** Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARGB – **$49.90**  
**Motherboard:** Gigabyte B650 AORUS ELITE AX V2 ATX AM5 – **$222.99**  
**Memory:** Corsair Vengeance RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL36 – **$522.50**  
**Storage:** Samsung 990 EVO 2 TB M.2-2280 NVMe – **$219.45**  
**Video Card:** Asus DUAL OC Radeon RX 7800 XT 16 GB – **$699.99**  
**Case:** Fractal Design Pop Air ATX Mid Tower – **$141.99**  
**Power Supply:** Corsair RM750e (2025) 750 W Fully Modular ATX – **$124.99**

**Total:** **$2421.79 CAD**

A few thoughts / questions:

* I’m guessing the Ryzen 9 7900X might be overkill for Unreal, and that a Ryzen 7 7700 / 7800X3D / 7600 might be enough.
* Do the **RAM prices** look sane for 32 GB DDR5?
* Is the **Samsung 990 EVO** overkill? Is there a cheaper 2 TB NVMe that’s still totally fine for projects?
* Case/PSU/cooler *seem* reasonable to me, but I’m open to cheaper alternatives that are still good quality.

What I’m hoping to get here:

* Suggestions for **specific part swaps** to bring this down to something more affordable (ideally around **$1800–$1900 CAD**).
* A sanity check on any obvious compatibility issues or dumb choices.
* **CPU vs GPU balance** advice.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Title: MasterLiquid ML360R with LGA 1700

Question/Post: Ive had an ML360R for my cpu cooler for several years now, and its been extremely reliable, but I am looking into upgrading my cpu and motherboard soon, going to a i5 14600kf and z690-plus, I remember when looking into upgrades in the past I realized I would need to get a mounting bracket for the cooler to fit LGA1700 from cooler master, however I cannot find much info anymore.

Is it still possible to get a mounting bracket for this AIO to be compatible with LGA1700? Or do I have to get a new AIO too

Title: Upgrade PC now or wait?

Question/Post: Title. I have a 5 year old system:
B450 steel legends motherboard
Gpu GTX 1660 super
Ryzen 5 3600
ddr4 2 X 8 gb

I play at 1080p and typically go for budget components. I'm thinking of buying the intel B580 or b570 as I've found good deals on those, compared to the disgusting prices for AMD and Nvidia GPUs, but that would require a motherboard upgrade, which would mean a cpu upgrade and ram upgrade as well. I'm really not sure if that's a good idea, I can't find any good prices for ddr5 ram in Singapore where i live, with how terrible the prices are right now.

Wondering if I should wait and see if the prices go down. Ram in particular is too much, the cheapest I could find it was $130 for Corsair vengeance 2x16GB DDR5 5200MHz C40.

Title: My monitor only has 2 VESA mount screws?

Question/Post: I bought a monitor (Aopen 24KG3Y) 2nd hand and I see that there are two screws on the back that fan attach to my VESA mount setup (I believe 75mm x 75mm), but shouldn't VESA mounts have 4 screws? 

I can technically attach it to the mount still but it'll be pretty flimsy.

The website itself even states that the monitor is VESA compatible (source https://www.aopen.com/CA_en/products_info/24KG3Y_M3/)

Am I missing something?

This was a prebuilt I bought a couple years back. I've since upgraded the Ram to the current 64gb and added an additional 2TB Crucial SSD. I don't game fairly often but I'd say the games I do play are about average demand on the system (Cyberpunk, Red Dead , etc). This is definitely more of an editing rig than anything else.  
  
If I was to upgrade the GPU how much of the current system would need to change to accommodate that?

Title: Brand new PC having blackscreen issue. Pls Help!

Question/Post: Hey, this is my second time around building a gaming PC (did it with my dad). On my original pc, 32 gigs of ram, rtx 3070, i9 10900kf, I had this blackscreen issue and originally, turning off XMP for ram worked. The issue returned later and seemingly, might've been an overheating issue? I am not sure, but after removing the side panels to let the PC breathe, I didn't really have the issue. 

I am now having this same issue on an rtx 5070ti, ryzen 7 9800x3d 8 core, 1500watt psu. I have expo mode enabled and might disable it to see if it helps, but why would it not work in the first place?! I built this beast for a damn reason. Anyway, the first time I played an intense game was Cyberpunk 2077 at 2k ultra max everything. There were no issues for a couple hours. Come to last night, and it black screened in no time. I was even playing a 2d game today and same shit, at least after I opened a chrome window.

I will say that I did the 'install all' for drivers on the Asus website (motherboard is asus B650 E E something), and it installed amd graphics drivers, which I am hoping is not the cause. I tried deleting those for the most part, not sure I got it all gone. Does anyone have an idea as to what's happening? The airflow in this case is far better and temps remain below 60-65 celsius on the gpu, while the cpu seems to be doing fine too. I need tips or tricks or help, please.

Question/Post: I’m not good with PCs. I just got a PC last week and I keep getting sent to a Windows screen everytime I boot it up. The options are Continue, Use a device, Troubleshoot, or Turn off your PC.

Regardless of what option I chose, I keep getting the error code 8007139f

I’m using Google and ChatGPT to help fix this but curious if anyone had any unique solutions. Thanks

Title: Looking for advice on setting up case fans to maintain positive pressure

Question/Post: I'm putting the finishing touches on my first PC build, and I'm finding myself quite puzzled by how to set up the case fans to make the best use of the resources I have. The pieces of the puzzle I currently have are:

* 2x Fractal Aspect 14 14mm 3-pin fans (41 CFM) that came mounted to the front of the case
* 2x Arctic P12 PWM PST 12mm 4-pin fans (56.3 CFM) I mounted to the back and top of the case
* A motherboard with 3 sys fan inputs
* Insufficient cable length to actually plug anything into the motherboard.

I've read that a positive pressure setup is preferred to minimize dust build up (and I **hate** dusting), but if I'm understating the numbers correctly, my exhaust fans are going to be moving much more air than the intake fans. I don't want to just ditch one of the fans, and there's not enough room to add another to the front.

Would the best way to reconcile this be to just run the exhaust fans at lower than max power? What sort or wiring would I need to do to accomplish that?

The cords I have all meet nicely in a central location, so a fan hub seems like a convenient way to get everything connected to the motherboard, but would I still be able to individually control the intake and exhaust fans that way? Would it be better to daisy chain the two exhaust fans into one sys fan input and the two intake fans into another?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Title: Not sure if it is ok to post here.. need help having problems after upgrading to 5070ti with 591.44 drivers

Question/Post: pc specs:

* 12600k cpu (ordered 2022)
* 5070ti msi gaming trio (ordered this last black friday)
* 64 gigs gskill ddr4 ram( ordered 2021)
* msi pro z690-a ddr4 mobo (ordered 2022)
* evga supernova 850 p2 220-p2-0850-x1 80+ platinum psu (ordered 2021)
* windows 11 (fresh install of windows os, not updated from w10)
* have windows hdr turned on

So i just finished installing my new gpu yesterday.. and i used nvidia app to update drivers. And was able to reboot with no problems..

Then after the teboot normally, soon i noticed some massive lag/slowdown just being on the windows desktop(and not have even fired up any game yet).. i noticed right clicking the mouse or even pressing start button was lagging up.. had my first blue screen with windows 11.. sometimes the computer would freeze itself that i have to press the power button to force shutdown.. 

I thought it is likely wallpaper engine giving me issues, coz i noticed after i do a restart from a forced shutdown, the app would give me some error message regarding the app not properly shutting down.. so i turned it off from automatically opening from start.. never had problems with wallpaper enging while i was using 2070s..

Then later yesterday evening, i booted into safemode and used ddu to uninstall nvdia driver and install the driver.. rebooted normally and everything felt back to normal.. no noticeable lag on desktop.. fired up cyberpunk and elder scrolls online and no problems ingame whatsoever..

Then just an hour ago, i noticed some lagging again while on desktop.. haven’t even fired up any game at all.. moving the mouse, right clicking, or even pressing the start button have a very noticeable lag.. even desktop froze after i tried to watch a youtube video i had to force shutdown..

I currently have a steamdeck to at least keep me going, but it feels like i’m having buyer’s remorse with current problems.. heck even when i upgraded from 980ti to 2070s i never had problems..

So idk what to do at this time, whether to downgrade back to using my 2070s for now or use a different driver other than 591.44 with the 5070ti..

The lastgpu driver i had with my 2070s was 551.23 before upgrading to 591.44 drivers with the 5070ti..

I need advice from everyone here, before i would considering bringing my desktop to geeksquad later this weekend..

Any help will be greatly appreciated..

Title: Upgrade or new build in 2026

Question/Post: Hey all, so with ram prices having skyrocketed but GPU prices being down, I am not quite sure where to go in regard to upgrading. I am on AM4 and have considered a 5700X3D to max out AM4, but I'm still on 16gb of DDR4. Meanwhile if I upgrade to AM5 that means buying inflated DDR5 ram and building a whole new rig. I do really want to upgrade my GPU to play more intensive games. Let me know what you guys think I should do in terms of upgrading in this current market. 

Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X

GPU: AMD Radeon RX 5700

PSU: EVGA 650 watt 80 Plus bronze

Memory: G.skill ripjaws DDR4 16GB

Motherboard: MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon Max Wifi (AM4)

Title: PC wont display anything - ASRock/Ryzen problem?

Question/Post: Hi guys,

i sport an ASRock X870 Steel Legend Wifi Mainboard, paired with a Ryzen 7 9800x3d. Bought it in the summer and sadly didnt read about the problems with this combination.

I used BIOS version 3.30 and all went fine until the beginning of the week. Somehow, when i booted the PC, i didnt get any display (monitors stayed black and went inactive for not getting any input). I fixed it by having to boot the PC 3 or 4 times and then it worked flawlessly.

As that was getting on my nerves, i tried to fix stuff today: checked cables, removed GPU/RAM/SSDs/HDDs and put it back together.

Now i dont ever get a display. The PC seems to boot normally (error LEDs are not showing, more specifically, only one green LED is on), all fans spin. I already removed CMOS battery and switched from my GPU (yes, i removed it) to the internal GPU of the board, with no change to the problem.

I fizzled with different RAM constellations (no RAM, only one bank, switched them around) and in one or two situations, suddenly the board showed the red LED for CPU. But after another reboot, green LED all the way.

I also BIOS flashbacked to 3.50, no change.

I am running out of ideas here - could it be a dead CPU as well? I dont have another (or a colleague/friend who could share one) to test it myself. Any possibility to verify this?

If not, what do i do? Send the CPU back to Mindfactory where i bought it? Will they send me a new one for no charge, what is the experience here?

And if so, do i keep that f\*ckin board???

Thanks in advance!

Julian

Title: What GPU Upgrade makes sense?

Question/Post: Hi all, 
trying to upgrade a prebuilt I bought probably six years ago now. Stats are: 

Intel i5 10400F - GeForce RTX 2060 - 16GB DDR4 - 512GB SSD - 600w PSU

I want to upgrade my gpu, I am considering the 5060TI, 9070, or the 9070XT. It seems like if I get the 9070xt I need to upgrade my PSU, but the price difference between the 9070 and the 9070XT is pretty small (like 60-80bucks). Meanwhile, the 5060ti is like 100 dollars less than the 9070. I play Baldurs gate, warhammer 3, and want to play god of war soon. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Sorry I am a noob and don’t know much about how this works.

Title: Wired ethernet issues.

Question/Post: Okay so i just recently had wired internet installed in my house with cat 6. But the damn thing is capped at 100mbps my isp plan is only like 300mbps max i think. I get around 250-270mbps on wifi but never even 100 on cable. Now my problem is my motherboard is a b550m-wifi ii which says it comes with built in wifi and 1g realtek ethernet. Yet that's not the case? All drivers are installed my router should be capable of 1gb ports according the info ive seen but i have no contacted my isp yet. I can't buy a new pci network card either because my gpu is blocking it. So if its a mobo isssue would buying a usb network adaptor thing help in any way? Ethernet issues is not my strong point and i feel i've explored 90% of the common issues for this problem to no avail. It's really bugging me because i paid good money to have set cable installed to not receive speeds matching my plan.

Title: Are these relevant today? Upgrade time

Question/Post: Hi all,

I am looking to upgrade my gpu and cpu. I currently have the Tomahawk B450 mobo. I have a 1666 syper and amd ryzen 5 3800.

  
I was thinking about upgrading to a 9060xt gpu, and a amd ryzen 7 5800x. Would that be worth it for a snappy, budget pc with occasional gaming?   The gpu is a few years old, is that the best bang for buck? ​

Title: AMD or Intel for this budget build, is there a real difference?

Question/Post: I was tasked by my family to build a budget PC, it will be mostly be used for office stuff and browsing, but it will also might be used for learning a CAD program.

After spending some time to search for components, I came to a build and I have two variants: one with AMD CPU and one with Intel. The price difference is small (around 20$). 

**RAM:** G.Skill Aegis 16GB DDR4 3200MHz CL16 Dual Channel Kit
**PSU:** MSI MAG A650GL, 80+ Gold, 650W (tier B)
**SSD:** Lexar NQ790 1TB PCI Express 4.0 x4 M.2 2280

ADM Version
**Motherboard:** GIGABYTE B550M DS3H
**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 **5600G** 3.9GHz box

Intel Version:
**Motherboard:**  GIGABYTE B760M H DDR4
**CPU:** Intel Alder Lake, Core i5 **12600K** 3.7GHz box

**+ GPU:** I haven't decided on a GPU yet. I was planning on adding it later if necessary, but with the prices only going up, I'll most likely decide to add it now.

What would you recommend between AMD and Intel? Is there a real difference if you don't use them for crazy stuff? Do you have any recommendations on the rest of the build? I would really appreciate some input, thank you!

Title: Havn bf 360 noise issues

Question/Post: So I bought the Havn of 360 flow for the quality it seemed to have but after 1-2 weeks I noticed that the fans did som weird faint noises below 25 rpm (which i like to have it on when watching content on my pc). Sounds like a vacuum cleaner sound at very low levels of course, and a sound similar to how a refrigerator sounds (which strangly enough could only be heard with headphones on). So I decided to return that flow version and get the non flow version to get the 140mm bracket and install the latest noctua a14 g2 fans thinking it would give me a peace of mind. But I heard a faint humming noise that comes in waves, at low rpm i didnt hear before. So I thought I'd try the be quiet silent wings 4 highspeed. And the hum is still there. So now I'm thinking there's some kind of airflow issue. When I turn all the fans off through bios, except for the aio fans the noise is reduced by alot. You almost can't hear it and is much less frequent. And before someone says it's my aio fan pump, it's not i know how it sounds and it's a constant noise that isn't audible at the rpm I've set it to.

Did anyone experience similar things with the bf 360 or the flow version?
Anyone have some ideas to try before I return tha case and all the fans? The return window for the flow case ends on saturday.

Title: I need help with my new build (Temperatures Problems)

Question/Post: [https://imgur.com/a/9uDmDaK](https://imgur.com/a/9uDmDaK)

I recently built a PC with a Ryzen 7 9700X. It’s performing well, but I have a problem with the temperatures. I bought a KryoSheet from Thermal Grizzly  
Thermal Grizzly KryoSheet (1.299 x 1.299 x 0.008 in\*\*)\*\* — the one that the company recommends. But during installation it was different because it had an oily liquid to help the pad stick. I think I applied too much, but I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing the problems.

The cooler is a Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO. Because of the space in my case, I didn’t put the fans over the RAM; instead, I placed them in the middle and at the end, as you can see in the video. The CPU sits at about 54°C when idle, but when I’m gaming it goes up to almost 90°C, and I don’t want to damage my CPU.

Title: New M.2 drive not recognized in slot 1, but other M.2 drives are, also new M.2 drive is recognized in slot 3.

Question/Post: Lot to explain so bear with me here...

I needed more space as my primary drive was nearing full, it is a Corsair MP600 2TB M.2 drive. So, I got the Corsair MP700 4TB M.2 drive as an upgrade. My MoBo has three M.2 slots and before the new drive; I was already using all three slots, my primary drive was in slot 1 and extra storage drives were in slots 2 and 3.

So, I removed the M.2 drive that was in slot 3 and put my new MP700 4TB drive in that slot, so I could clone my primary to this new drive. I used Macrium Reflect to clone the drive and chose the option to expand the proper partition, this way I was utilizing the whole 4TB drive, leaving no unallocated space. It said the clone was successful.

So then I removed my old primary drive in slot 1, and put my new MP700 drive into that slot. I also put my other M.2 drive that was in slot 3 back in slot 3. Connected everything back up and turned on my system. It did not boot into windows, so I restarted and loaded into the bios. In the bios I went to check my NVMe drives and my MP700 drive was not showing up. I also checked in the boot options section and it was not showing up there either. This led me to do some further testing.

So I put my old primary drive, the MP600, back into slot 1. Then I took the storage M.2 drive back out of slot 3 and put my new MP700 drive back in slot 3. Connected everything back up again and turned on my system. It booted into windows and after checking it booted as my old MP600 as the primary drive.

I then restarted my system and loaded bios. The bios could see all 3 m.2 drives. So, then I went to the boot options section and chose to boot to my new MP700 4TB drive. Upon doing so the bios closed and it booted into windows, this time my new MP700 4TB drive was the primary drive. So yay that the clone did work and is bootable.

After this, I powered down and then removed my old MP600 drive from slot 1 and then put my storage M.2 drive, that used to be in slot 3 before I got my new drive, into that slot. For point of reference, in case it matters for some reason, the M.2 drive is a Samsung 960 Pro 1TB. Then I connected everything back up again and turned on my system. Loaded into bios first. In bios were I can see my NVMe drives it showed all three drives. So I exited bios and booted into windows. In windows it showed all connected drives, my new MP700 as the primary and then my other two M.2 drives that I use as storage.

So what I am struggling to understand and am wanting to fix is why my new MP700 4TB drive is not recognized in slot 1 but is recognized and bootable when in slot 3, and my other M.2 drives are all recognized in slot 1 if I connect them there.

Your help is greatly appreciated as I’ve spent the last two days trying to solve this on my own via googling and reading any articles I could find. However, I could not find anything mentioning this exact problem that I am having. Thanks for your help in advance.

Title: Will this setup be good for what I do?

Question/Post: I'm planning on building a new PC, expect for my two M.2 SSDs which will be carried over from the current one. It's going to be Linux exclusive (Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS) and I will be using it for:



\- Office work, mainly maintaining my online business, which includes some web design and editing of large spreadsheets.

\- Architecture and machine part design in FreeCAD. The latter is related to my business, doing CAD models of the items I sell.

\- Gaming in 3440x1440 rasterised, I don't care much for raytracing and its implementation on Linux sucks anyway.

\- Video editing in DaVinci Resolve.



I would like the system to last until the end of the decade. I have selected these parts:



\- Fractal Design North XL

\- Thermaltake ToughPower GT Gold 850W

\- MSI Tomahawk WiFi B650

\- AMD Ryzen 9 9900X

\- Be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5

\- 48 GB (2x24) Crucial DDR5-5600 CL46

\- XTX Radeon RX 7900 XTX Speedster Merc 310 Black Edition



These parts should all be compatible with each other (also physically, e.g. video card fitting into case, CPU cooler not obstructing RAM modules), and total price would be some €2,100 including tax.

My reasoning for choosing  the 12-core 9900X over a 9800X3D is that it would offer better performance in DaVinci Resolve and that future games may utilise more than eight cores, especially after Zen 6 comes out. Also the 9900X would not bottleneck the GPU at 3440x1440, so the 9800X3D would not give me any advantage right now and may even fall behind in future titles.

I know the RAM isn’t the best out there, but it’s the most affordable option right now and you all know about RAM prices. 

So, am I going seriously wrong on anything here considering my usage profile? Any suggestions to replace parts in the above list with similarly priced ones? I wouldn’t want the total to go up any further.

Title: DDR4 RAM in India – buy now or wait?

Question/Post: I have an MSI Bravo 15 B5DD laptop with 8GB DDR4 3200MHz SODIMM. I bought a 16GB StarLite stick in 2022, but it caused BSODs recently, so I removed it. Now multitasking is hard – 10 tabs feel cramped compared to 50 earlier. I want to use this laptop until 2029 for a Data Science degree and work. DDR4 prices in India are rising. Should I buy a new stick now or wait and risk even higher prices or scarcity?

Title: Cost-efficient am4 PC upgrade

Question/Post: Hello, currently I have a computer with such spec:

MB: B350M MORTAR MS-7A37 
CPU: AMD RYZEN 5 1600 
RAM: 24 GB DDR4 3200MHz (2x4, 2x8) 
GPU: MSI GTX 1050ti 4GB 
PSU: CORSAIR 550W 
Storage: 1Tb HDD + 1Tb SSD

Resolution in want to play on: Asus 2560x1440 up to 240Hz

This is the build I completed in 2017 and it has been serving me quite well for the past 8 years (I used the computer for less demanding games like LoL, CS2 etc.).

Over the years I added more RAM and storage.

Now I would love to upgrade it so that it can be a decent build for the next 5-6 years and would allow me to play some more demanding games (rdr2, gta5, gta6 and some future ones) on &gt;50fps with at least medium settings.

Budget: My budget is very flexible, but I don't think I need 5080 or the newest high-end CPU's as I don't feel like I would use them efficiently. I was thinking on some good price-value ratio upgrade without changing AM4 socket.

I was thinking about: 
CPU -&gt; AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 
GPU -&gt; GTX 5070 12GB or GTX 5060ti 16GB or GTX 5060ti 8GB 
RAM -&gt; with current spike in prices I would like to stay on 24GB or maybe buy 2x16 DDR4 to make it 32GB 
PSU -&gt; 750W be quiet!? Will it be enough?

I would like to know if this configuration is optimal or something can be changed (maybe it is worth to go for 5070ti? for few extra $)?

Title: Computer can’t go past OS boot sequence

Question/Post: Hi.

At first I want to say that I know a bit about computers but I am slowly starting to lose my sanity with this one. Either way I am fine with a bit more technical speak.

Here’s the deal: computer crashes hard (no signal on display but power is still on, sometimes it reboots itself instead of hanging) shortly after starting to load the OS. It doesn’t matter if it is Windows 10, Windows 11, Linux Mint or whatever but Damn Small Linux off CD. Windows can go up to copying files but it crashes at random moments, Linux can’t even display desktop (sometimes show splashscreen or some mce-related message and proceed to crash). Temps are okay, low to mid 30s in BIOS while idle. Oh, and it can chill in BIOS for half an hour and it is not crashing for some reason.

Short specs are: TUF B450M-PRO GAMING, Ryzen 5 2600x, 4x4GB HyperX 2133MHz DDR4 RAMs, SAPPHIRE RX470 4GB, Chieftec 600W PSU and a simple 256GB m.2 drive.

What I tried:
- reflashing the BIOS to the newest,
- resetting CMOS,
- reseating everything,
- different GPU,
- different PSU,
- putting RAMs one by one + obligatory memtest,
- reassuring that cooling is okay so fresh paste and adjusting fan curves and stuff like that,
- unplugging everything unnecessary,
- installing an OS off DVD instead of USB.

Ironically I had a working instance of Linux Mint on this rig that was working well enough to let me copy some files between drives but I wanted to install Windows 10 and that’s how it is now.

Now here’s a question: are my BIOS settings somehow upside-down or it is some hardware issue? How even I can check what is wrong when all I can boot to is DSL?

Thanks in advance.

Title: Before prices get crazy I’m strongly considering the 9070xt but I have some concerns.

Question/Post: My concerns aren’t about gaming as it seems that this card will handle those workloads no problem. However, I’ve been getting into content creation workloads using davinci resolve to edit videos and I often use the fusion tab within davinci. Also I’d like to stream and record gameplay. According to pugetsystems for davinci the 9070xt should be ok but it does fail at anything ai and there are some tools in davinci that can utilize that. After effects is also bad performance with said card but I don’t use after effects at the moment so maybe it’s not a huge issue. Currently I use a 3060ti so the card overall would be a significant upgrade for me but I am just worried that down the line I might regret my purchase. Has anyone had experience with the 9070xt with my use case? How has your experience been? Thanks in advance!

Title: Wanting to refresh my rig, been a decade since I've looked into what's good and what's crap. Any assistance figuring out what bits of my system are still good and where I could easily improve would be much appreciated!!

Question/Post: Parts are as follows:

Core i7 9700k @ 3.60 (8 CPUs)

2x 16GB DDR4 PC4-21300, 2666MHz

GeForce RTX 3090

EVGA 850 g5 psu

Samsung SSD - 1tb (and an M2 one too!)

It's based out of an old 90JF0082US, but I've swapped out just about everything except the mobo, CPU, case and AIO cooling over the years. The though of swapping the latter out frankly terrifies me xD

Any suggestions would be immensely appreciated!

EDIT:: I primarily use this machine for Substance Painter and Unity tinkering related to VRChat, as well as the usual Monster Hunter-y Dark Souls-y games that are popular these days. :B

Title: How do thermal pads (Kryosheet) compare to thermal paste?

Question/Post: First I'd like to say personally speaking, I cant help but stress over thermal paste. No matter how I apply it, I will always see temps and think to myself maybe if I applied it better the temps would be better. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with thermal paste it's just a personal issue, I can't help but feel anxious. 

Now that personal bs is out the way. I heard about Thermal Grizzly Kryosheets. Are they a good alternative? Has anyone tried them? I haven't found a lot of info on them but a solution where you just place a pad sounds very peaceful for my mind.

Title: New build, worked for two weeks, now fails to boot

Question/Post: Hello all,

I have encountered some issues with a new built after having it run succesfully, and after following tons of steps I found online with no success, I'm getting rather desperate so I'm hoping to find some useful advice here.

A few weeks ago I built a new mid-tier gaming PC after my previous one (mid-tier pc from early 2017) started showing its age. It is the first time I assembled one myself, followed advice from friends and did tons of research. Obviously RAM was the biggest issue, but ultimately I bought a kit before the big price surge happened, but they were rapidly selling out everywhere. Link to my build: [https://be.pcpartpicker.com/user/TaliBram/saved/#view=thTPgs](https://be.pcpartpicker.com/user/TaliBram/saved/#view=thTPgs)

At first, I seemed to be succesful. Everything ran smoothly for the past two weeks, I installed some games on it and they all worked fine, even with max settings, and temperatures seemed to be well under control. Yesterday however, when I tried to shut down my PC, my display shut off as expected, but the fans kept spinning and the power button started blinking rapidly (3-4 times per second). I couldn't get my display to turn on again either. Ultimately, I had to force a shutdown via the power button after more than an hour of nothing happening.

So today I searched all over the internet, watched videos, in hopes of troubleshooting. Alas, no luck.  
What I found is the following: [https://www.asus.com/us/support/faq/1046157/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/faq/1046157/) \-&gt; rapidly blinking power button is a RAM issue.  
But then I also found on the page for my specific mobo ([https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b650-plus-wifi/](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-b650-plus-wifi/)) that it means *No CPU Detected*

Perhaps worthwhile to note that I used EXPO, for which my RAM kit is rated as far as I can tell.

After following advice from friends and online (reddit, tech sites, manufacturer websites), I have attempted all of the following to try and single out any potential issue:

\- **PSU Cables**: Reslotted every single one multiple times, tried spare cables where possible. **No changes**  
\- **PSU**: Removed PSU from my old working PC and connected my new pc components to this one. Old one also has slightly higher voltage (700W vs 650W). **No changes**  
\- **GPU**: Replaced, tried with and without it in (by connecting to integrated gfx), tried the other PCIE slot, tried all 4 cables attached to my PSU. **No changes**  
\- **Display**: Tried two different screens (which work on other systems I have), both displayport and HDMI, different cables. **No changes**  
\- **SSD**: Booted with and without, tried booting with the SSD from my old PC. **No changes**  
\- **RAM**: Initially connected to A2-B2 as per instructions, but tried one by one and all combinations of slots, making sure they were pushed in all the way -&gt; **This seems to make a slight change**: depending on where I place them, the power button will not start blinking and instead remain solid. Otherwise no change, fans still running yet still no display. Blinking still happens in the A2-B2 config.  
\- **CPU**: reseated, thermal paste reapplied but it seemed to already cover the whole surface before. **No changes**  
\- **Cleared CMOS** through both removal of battery and through short-circuiting the CLRTC pins on mobo (as per manual instructions). **No changes**  
\- **BIOS Flashback**: Succesfully completed as far as I can tell. **No changes**

Tomorrow I will try to test my RAM sticks in a friend's PC to hopefully find out more...

TL;DR: New PC not fully booting anymore after having succesfully ran for 2 weeks. Followed many options to troubleshoot, without succes. Most likely culprits, as far as I can tell: mobo, CPU, RAM.

Thank you for your help!

AMD Ryzen 7 9700X - 370$  
AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D - 485$

I'm gonna use them for general productivity stuff, music production, gaming - pretty much anything including relatively niche CPU intensive stuff like probably Star Citizen maybe Minecraft stuff and whatever else I might wanna do.

I'm planning to pair it with 32GB of RAM and either a 5070 or a 5070ti. I'm kinda in a hurry to buy cause I'm terrified of prices going even higher (mainly for RAM...). I should have bought this stuff a week ago :(

Title: Help with stable RAM speeds

Question/Post: Hello, I just recently built my first ever custom PC and it’s pretty nice. I got a 5070ti, ryzen 7 7800x3D, and an x870E aorus elite MB. originally i had 2x16gb DDR5 corsair vengeance RAM. But, I got gifted another set of the exact same RAM for my birthday. Now i have 4x16gb. I know people say not to use all 4 channels so I don’t exactly know how to move forward. RAM is so expensive so I can’t just buy 2 sticks or 32gb at the moment. Should i use all 4 and just lower the speeds? If that’s the case, I see controversy on what to set the speeds to. If i was to change the speeds, how do i check that it’s stable once i’ve changed the speeds as well? help if you know please &lt;3

Title: What Argb controllers would you reccomend for a cheap price

Question/Post: Hello, im going to be upgrading my pc case and cooler, i will be getting a Lian Li Vector V100 and getting an ARCTIC Liquid freezer III. Ive ran into the problem though that my motherboard does not have an ARGB header meaning ill have to buy an ARGB Controller. The only problem though is that i just dont know which controller to get, either its impossible to find one, or they are all overkill and out of my budget. Im planning to get a Corsair Commander Duo if i cant find any for cheaper since i want to get a controller that i can directly control from my pc using an app instead of just buttons. If anyone can find me a cheaper controller which has enough headers for the aio, included fans, case lights with a few to spare (optionally i dont mind if it is just enough) it would be a great help!

Title: Ryzen 5 9600x overheating problem

Question/Post: Hello everyone!

My buddy just got a new PC, he got all the parts and guy at local PC service shop built it for him (I guess he didn't trust me enough hehe). He got radeon rx 9060 xt and ryzen 5 9600x. 

I was at his place today and I tried Cinebench. CPU is at 65w TDP (we did not unlock it to full 105w TDP) and he has decent cooler (I can't remember the name, but it has two fans and looks decent, about 50€). Temps were reaching even 95°C (I guess then thermal throttle took place).

I have r7 9700x in my pc and I built it by myself, with Arctic Freezer e36 (cheaper than his cooler) and I've unlocked full 105w TDP, yet my temps never exceed 85°C at same Cinebench test.

Could it be that we overlooked something or the guys at PC shop simply didn't install the cooler properly? We didn't feel like messing around with removing the cooler today, so I'm asking if there's something else going on, unrelated to the cooler, or are such temperatures simply normal for that CPU (which makes no sense).

Title: SSD Not Showing Up in BIOS / Windows Install

Question/Post: Upgraded my cpu / motherboard and am having an issue with the SSDs not showing up in the BIOS or as valid drives during windows install. Want to just wipe the SSD and install windows on it fresh, but since the drives aren't showing up anywhere I don't see any steps I can take -- I assume it would be a connection issue then, but I haven't been able to find anything wrong. 



Motherboard: Asus B650E MAX GAMING WIFI W ATX AM5 Motherboard (Upgraded from Gigabyte GA-Z170MX-Gaming 5 Micro ATX LGA1151 Motherboard)

CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D 4.3 GHz 16-Core Processor (Upgraded from Intel Core i7-6700 3.4 GHz Quad-Core Processor)

Memory: 	G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 

Storage: 	Samsung 850 Evo 1 TB 2.5" Solid State Drive

GPU: EVGA XC3 ULTRA GAMING GeForce RTX 3070 Ti

PSU: Corsair RM850 850 W 80+

  
Things I have tried:

\* Removed all additional power draws like GPU

\* Used 3 different SSDs (all Samsung EVOs) on different SATA cables and into different SATA ports on the motherboard -- dont have another machine to test the drives in, but don't see how all 3 could be faulty, especially since 2 were working in my previous setup

\* Tried every setting I could think of in the BIOS, but I haven't spent much time messing with BIOS so I wouldn't be surprised if I missed something there

Title: CPU and GPU usage - i5-12400F and RTX 5060 ti 16GB

Question/Post: Not a newbie on PC but totally a newbie on configs and optimizing my components. 

Hi. A few days ago I bought an RTX 5060 Ti 16GB for 450€ (saw it a good opportunity). I also have 32GB RAM and i5-12400F.

Before I had an RTX 3060. 

  
I only tested the new RTX on BF6 and KCD2. 

  
On both games my CPU is 100% usage and GPU around 15% (both stable, no FPS drop or similar) but using benchmarks it says that before (with RTX 3060) had a Gpu bottleneck and now I shouldn't. Also, I have seen a video from somebody using i5-12400F and 5060 ti 16GB who had 100% GPU usage and 40% CPU usage. 

On both games I get around 100fps stables (on battlefield with medium settings and KCD2 on ultra settings; 1080p) and before with the 3060 I had 90fps on low in BF6 and I can't remember well the performance on KCD2.

Also I still want to try my new RTX 5060 on Spiderman 2 and Cyberpunk 2077.

My question is: 

1. how is it possible that that video has different usage from mine? His: 100 GPU and 40 CPU - Me (on the same game and same game config) 15 GPU and 100 CPU

2. How can I boost my GPU usage? 

3. If these games are CPU intensive, do I have to worry? Can I force more GPU usage in CPU intensive games?

4. Should I upgrade my CPU? Which one? I do not want to spend 900€ on a CPU but I don't want to feel like it is bottlenecking but later on benchmarking and the report saying there is no bottleneck. 

5. Do you have any more recommendations for me?  

  
I repeat, I am new, so if you see some obvious shit or something atrocious, don't insult me, please. If you need any more info in order to be able to give me advice ask me for it.

  
Thanks in advance, community.

Title: 2021 build obsoletion?

Question/Post: hello. I built my PC in 2021 and used it for a bit but have barely touched it (life stuff) and due to my absence/disinterest, im totally out of tune with hard and software 

I am going back to school though, and need it again. Some of the classes will be demanding on the PC 

The computer works fine but I’m a little worried about how soon it will be obsolete (if it’s not already) and if it will be able to reliably keep up with the newer stuff 

  
the main components I’m worried about are the motherboard and the cpu 

mobo: Gigabyte Z490 LGA 1200

cpu: 10th gen i7

  
I built it with longevity in mind, but uh.. it’s been kinda long already. 

  
how much longer do you think I’ll NEED to upgrade? what won’t my cpu be able to keep up with? 

  
the gpu is a 3070, I am not worried about that just yet

Title: So, My sister needs a rig for running Aerodynamics simulations from 3d renders and she needs like 256 gigs of ram in it, what are our options now?

Question/Post: Pretty much that, need like 256 gigs of DDR5 ram, idk what to do because it's costing much more than the whole system itself.
