Question: What's the difference between DDR4 and DDR5 RAM?

Answer: DDR5 RAM offers higher speeds (up to 6400MHz+) compared to DDR4 (typically 2133-3200MHz). DDR5 also has improved power efficiency with lower voltage (1.1V vs 1.2V) and higher bandwidth. However, DDR5 typically has higher latency and is more expensive. For most gaming and everyday use, DDR4 is still excellent value.

Question: How much power supply wattage do I need for an RTX 4090?

Answer: NVIDIA recommends an 850W power supply for the RTX 4090, but many users opt for 1000W or higher for headroom and efficiency. The 4090 has a 450W TDP, so you need to account for your CPU (100-250W), motherboard, drives, and other components. A quality 1000W PSU from brands like Corsair, EVGA, or Seasonic is recommended.

Question: Is 16GB RAM enough for gaming in 2024?

Answer: 16GB RAM is still adequate for most gaming in 2024, but 32GB is becoming the recommended amount for new builds. Some modern games like Star Citizen, Cyberpunk 2077, and flight simulators can use more than 16GB. If you multitask (gaming while streaming/browsing), 32GB provides much better headroom.

Question: How important is RAM speed for gaming?

Answer: RAM speed matters, but with diminishing returns. For Intel, 3200-3600MHz DDR4 or 5600MHz+ DDR5 is ideal. AMD Ryzen benefits more from faster RAM due to Infinity Fabric; aim for 3600MHz CL16 DDR4 or 6000MHz DDR5. Going beyond these speeds shows minimal gaming improvement (1-5 fps) but helps in productivity workloads.

Question: What's the best CPU for gaming and streaming?

Answer: For gaming and streaming, you need strong multi-core performance. Best options: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X/7800X3D (8 cores), Intel Core i7-13700K/14700K (16 cores with E-cores), or Ryzen 9 7900X (12 cores) for heavy streaming. The extra cores handle encoding while gaming. Alternatively, use NVENC (NVIDIA GPU encoding) with a mid-range CPU like i5-13600K or Ryzen 5 7600X.

Question: What's PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0?

Answer: PCIe 5.0 offers double the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0 (32 GT/s vs 16 GT/s). For GPUs, PCIe 4.0 x16 is still more than enough for even RTX 4090. PCIe 5.0 is most relevant for next-gen NVMe SSDs reaching 10-14 GB/s speeds. Most users don't need PCIe 5.0 yet, but it provides future-proofing for upcoming hardware.

Agraphics processing unit(GPU) is a specializedelectronic circuitdesigned fordigital image processingand to acceleratecomputer graphics, being present either as a component on a discretegraphics cardor embedded onmotherboards,mobile phones,personal computers,workstations, andgame consoles. GPUs were later found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involvingembarrassingly parallelproblems due to theirparallel structure. The ability of GPUs to rapidly perform vast numbers of calculations has led to their adoption in diverse fields includingartificial intelligence(AI) where they excel at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training ofneural networksandcryptocurrency mining.

Arcade system boardshave used specialized graphics circuits since the 1970s. In early video game hardware,RAMfor frame buffers was expensive, so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor.[1]

A specializedbarrel shiftercircuit helped the CPU animate theframebuffergraphics for various 1970sarcade video gamesfromMidwayandTaito, such asGun Fight(1975),Sea Wolf(1976), andSpace Invaders(1978).[2]TheNamco Galaxianarcade system in 1979 used specializedgraphics hardwarethat supportedRGB color, multi-colored sprites, andtilemapbackgrounds.[3]The Galaxian hardware was widely used during thegolden age of arcade video games, by game companies such asNamco,Centuri,Gremlin,Irem,Konami, Midway,Nichibutsu,Sega, and Taito.[4]

TheAtari 2600in 1977 used a video shifter called theTelevision Interface Adaptor.[5]Atari 8-bit computers(1979) hadANTIC, a video processor which interpreted instructions describing a "display list"—the way the scan lines map to specificbitmappedor character modes and where the memory is stored (so there did not need to be a contiguous frame buffer).[clarification needed][6]6502machine codesubroutinescould be triggered onscan linesby setting a bit on a display list instruction.[clarification needed][7]ANTIC also supported smoothverticalandhorizontal scrollingindependent of the CPU.[8]

TheNEC μPD7220was the first implementation of apersonal computergraphics display processor as a singlelarge-scale integration(LSI)integrated circuitchip. This enabled the design of low-cost, high-performance video graphics cards such as those fromNumber Nine Visual Technology. It became the best-known GPU until the mid-1980s.[9]It was the first fully integratedVLSI(very large-scale integration)metal–oxide–semiconductor(NMOS) graphics display processor for PCs, supported up to1024×1024 resolution, and laid the foundations for the PC graphics market. It was used in a number of graphics cards and was licensed for clones such as the Intel 82720, the first ofIntel's graphics processing units.[10]TheWilliams Electronicsarcade gamesRobotron: 2084,Joust,Sinistar, andBubbles, all released in 1982, contain customblitterchips for operating on 16-color bitmaps.[11][12]

In 1984,Hitachireleased the ARTC HD63484, the first majorCMOSgraphics processor for personal computers. The ARTC could display up to4K resolutionwhen inmonochromemode. It was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late 1980s.[13]In 1985, theAmigawas released with a custom graphics chip including a blitter for bitmap manipulation, line drawing, and area fill. It also included acoprocessorwith its own simple instruction set, that was capable of manipulating graphics hardware registers in sync with the video beam (e.g. for per-scanline palette switches,sprite multiplexing, and hardware windowing), or driving the blitter. In 1986,Texas Instrumentsreleased theTMS34010, the first fully programmable graphics processor.[14]It could run general-purpose code but also had a graphics-oriented instruction set. During 1990–1992, this chip became the basis of theTexas Instruments Graphics Architecture("TIGA")Windows acceleratorcards.

In 1987, theIBM 8514graphics system was released. It was one of the first video cards forIBM PC compatiblesthat implementedfixed-function2D primitives inelectronic hardware.Sharp'sX68000, released in 1987, used a custom graphics chipset[15]with a 65,536 color palette and hardware support for sprites, scrolling, and multiple playfields.[16]It served as a development machine forCapcom'sCP Systemarcade board. Fujitsu'sFM Townscomputer, released in 1989, had support for a 16,777,216 color palette.[17]In 1988, the first dedicatedpolygonal 3Dgraphics boards were introduced in arcades with theNamco System 21[18]andTaitoAir System.[19]

IBMintroduced itsproprietaryVideo Graphics Array(VGA) display standard in 1987, with a maximum resolution of 640×480 pixels. In November 1988,NEC Home Electronicsannounced its creation of theVideo Electronics Standards Association(VESA) to develop and promote aSuper VGA(SVGA)computer display standardas a successor to VGA. Super VGA enabledgraphics display resolutionsup to 800×600pixels, a 56% increase.[20]

In 1991,S3 Graphicsintroduced theS3 86C911, which its designers named after thePorsche 911as an indication of the performance increase it promised.[21]The 86C911 spawned a variety of imitators: by 1995, all major PC graphics chip makers had added2Dacceleration support to their chips.[22]Fixed-functionWindows acceleratorssurpassed expensive general-purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance, and such coprocessors faded from the PC market.

In the early- and mid-1990s,real-time3D graphics became increasingly common in arcade, computer, and console games, which led to increasing public demand for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. Early examples of mass-market 3D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as theSega Model 1,Namco System 22, andSega Model 2, and thefifth-generation video game consolessuch as theSaturn,PlayStation, andNintendo 64. Arcade systems such as the Sega Model 2 andSGIOnyx-based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in 1993 were capable of hardware T&L (transform, clipping, and lighting) years before appearing in consumer graphics cards.[23][24]Another early example is theSuper FXchip, aRISC-basedon-cartridge graphics chipused in someSNESgames, notablyDoomandStar Fox. Some systems usedDSPsto accelerate transformations.Fujitsu, which worked on the Sega Model 2 arcade system,[25]began working on integrating T&L into a singleLSIsolution for use in home computers in 1995;[26]the Fujitsu Pinolite, the first 3D geometry processor for personal computers, announced in 1997.[27]The first hardware T&L GPU onhomevideo game consoleswas theNintendo 64'sReality Coprocessor, released in 1996.[28]In 1997,Mitsubishireleased the3Dpro/2MP, a GPU capable of transformation and lighting, forworkstationsandWindows NTdesktops;[29]ATiused it for itsFireGL 4000graphics card, released in 1997.[30]

The term "GPU" was coined bySonyin reference to the 32-bitSony GPU(designed byToshiba) in thePlayStationvideo game console, released in 1994.[31]

In October 2002, with the introduction of theATIRadeon 9700(also known as R300), the world's firstDirect3D9.0 accelerator, pixel and vertexshaderscould implementloopingand lengthyfloating pointmath, and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs, yet orders of magnitude faster for image-array operations. Pixel shading is often used forbump mapping, which adds texture to make an object look shiny, dull, rough, or even round or extruded.[32]

With the introduction of the NvidiaGeForce 8 seriesand new generic stream processing units, GPUs became more generalized computing devices.ParallelGPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU computing orGPGPUforgeneral purpose computing on GPU, has found applications in fields as diverse asmachine learning,[33]oil exploration, scientificimage processing,linear algebra,[34]statistics,[35]3D reconstruction, andstock optionspricing. GPGPUs were the precursors to what is now called a compute shader (e.g.CUDA,OpenCL,DirectCompute) and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader.[clarification needed]This entails some overheads since units like thescan converterare involved where they are not needed (nor are triangle manipulations even a concern—except to invoke the pixel shader).[clarification needed]

Nvidia's CUDA platform, first introduced in 2007,[36]was the earliest widely adopted programming model for GPU computing. OpenCL is an open standard defined by theKhronos Groupthat allows for the development of code for both GPUs and CPUs with an emphasis on portability.[37]OpenCL solutions are supported by Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM, and according to a report in 2011 byEvans Data, OpenCL had become the second most popular HPC tool.[38]

In 2010, Nvidia partnered withAudito power their cars' dashboards, using theTegraGPU to provide increased functionality to cars' navigation and entertainment systems.[39]Advances in GPU technology in cars helped advanceself-driving technology.[40]AMD'sRadeon HD 6000 seriescards were released in 2010, and in 2011 AMD released its 6000M Series discrete GPUs for mobile devices.[41]TheKepler lineof graphics cards by Nvidia were released in 2012 and were used in the Nvidia 600 and 700 series cards. A feature in this GPU microarchitecture included GPU boost, a technology that adjusts the clock-speed of a video card to increase or decrease according to its power draw.[42]Kepler also introducedNVENCvideo encoding acceleration technology.

ThePS4andXbox Onewere released in 2013; they both used GPUs based onAMD's Radeon HD 7850 and 7790.[43]Nvidia's Kepler line of GPUs was followed by theMaxwellline, manufactured on the same process. Nvidia's 28 nm chips were manufactured byTSMCin Taiwan using the 28 nm process. Compared to the 40 nm technology from the past, this manufacturing process allowed a 20 percent boost in performance while drawing less power.[44][45]Virtual reality headsetshave high system requirements; manufacturers recommended the GTX 970 and the R9 290X or better at the time of their release.[46][47]Cards based on thePascalmicroarchitecture were released in 2016. TheGeForce 10 seriesof cards are of this generation of graphics cards. They are made using the 16 nm manufacturing process which improves upon previous microarchitectures.[48]

In 2018, Nvidia launched the RTX 20 series GPUs that addedray tracingcores to GPUs, improving their performance on lighting effects.[49]Polaris 11andPolaris 10GPUs from AMD are fabricated by a 14 nm process. Their release resulted in a substantial increase in the performance per watt of AMD video cards.[50]AMD also released the Vega GPU series for the high end market as a competitor to Nvidia's high end Pascal cards, also featuringHBM2like the Titan V.

In 2019, AMD released the successor to theirGraphics Core Next(GCN) microarchitecture/instruction set. DubbedRDNA, the first product featuring it was theRadeon RX 5000 seriesof video cards.[51]The company announced that the successor to the RDNA microarchitecture would be incremental (a "refresh"). AMD unveiled theRadeon RX 6000 series, itsRDNA 2graphics cards with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing.[52]The product series, launched in late 2020, consisted of the RX 6800, RX 6800 XT, and RX 6900 XT.[53][54]The RX 6700 XT, which is based on Navi 22, was launched in early 2021.[55]

ThePlayStation 5andXbox Series X and Series Swere released in 2020; they both use GPUs based on the RDNA 2 microarchitecture with incremental improvements and different GPU configurations in each system's implementation.[56][57][58]

In the 2020s, GPUs have been increasingly used for calculations involvingembarrassingly parallelproblems, such as training ofneural networkson enormous datasets that are needed for artificial intelligencelarge language models. Specialized processing cores on some modern workstation's GPUs are dedicated fordeep learningsince they have significantFLOPSperformance increases, using 4×4 matrix multiplication and division, resulting in hardware performance up to 128 TFLOPS in some applications.[59]These tensor cores are expected to appear in consumer cards, as well.[needs update][60]

Article: Central processing unit

Acentral processing unit(CPU), also called acentral processor,main processor, or justprocessor, is the primaryprocessorin a givencomputer.[1][2]Itselectronic circuitryexecutesinstructionsof acomputer program, such asarithmetic, logic, controlling, andinput/output(I/O) operations.[3][4][5]This role contrasts with that of external components, such asmain memoryand I/O circuitry,[6]and specializedcoprocessorssuch asgraphics processing units(GPUs).

The form,design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.[7]Principal components of a CPU include thearithmetic–logic unit(ALU) that performsarithmeticandlogic operations,processor registersthat supplyoperandsto the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and acontrol unitthat orchestrates thefetching (from memory),decodingandexecution (of instructions)by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and other components. Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor area tocachesandinstruction-level parallelismto increase performance and toCPU modesto supportoperating systemsandvirtualization.

Most modern CPUs are implemented onintegrated circuitmicroprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are calledmulti-core processors(MCP).[8]The individual physical CPUs, calledprocessor cores, can also bemultithreadedto support CPU-level multithreading.[9]

An IC that contains a CPU may also containmemory,peripheralinterfaces, and other components of a computer;[10]such integrated devices are variously calledmicrocontrollersorsystems on a chip(SoC).

Early computers such as theENIAChad to be physically rewired to perform different tasks, which caused these machines to be called "fixed-program computers".[11]The "central processing unit" term has been in use since as early as 1955.[12][13]Since the term "CPU" is generally defined as a device forsoftware(computer program) execution, the earliest devices that could rightly be called CPUs came with the advent of thestored-program computer.

The idea of a stored-program computer had already been present in the design ofJohn Presper EckertandJohn William Mauchly'sENIAC, but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner.[14]On June 30, 1945, before ENIAC was made, mathematicianJohn von Neumanndistributed a paper entitledFirst Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. It was the outline of a stored-program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949.[15]EDVACwas designed to perform a certain number of instructions (or operations) of various types. Significantly, the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high-speedcomputer memoryrather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer.[16]This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC, which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task.[17]With von Neumann's design, the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory. EDVAC was not the first stored-program computer; theManchester Baby, which was a small-scale experimental stored-program computer, ran its first program on 21 June 1948[18]and theManchester Mark 1ran its first program during the night of 16–17 June 1949.[19]

Early CPUs were custom designs used as part of a larger and sometimes distinctive computer.[20]However, this method of designing custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of multi-purpose processors produced in large quantities. This standardization began in the era of discretetransistormainframesandminicomputers, and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of theintegrated circuit(IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order ofnanometers.[21]Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in electronic devices ranging from automobiles[22]to cellphones,[23]and sometimes even in toys.[24][25]

While von Neumann is most often credited with the design of the stored-program computer because of his design of EDVAC, and the design became known as thevon Neumann architecture, others before him, such asKonrad Zuse, had suggested and implemented similar ideas.[26]The so-calledHarvard architectureof theHarvard Mark I, which was completed before EDVAC,[27][28]also used a stored-program design usingpunched paper taperather than electronic memory.[29]The key difference between the two is that Harvard architecture separates the storage and treatment of CPU instructions and data, whereas von Neumann architecture uses the same memory space for both.[30]Most modern CPUs are primarily von Neumann in design, but CPUs with the Harvard architecture are seen as well, especially in embedded applications; for instance, theAtmel AVRmicrocontrollers are Harvard-architecture processors.[31]

Prior to the invention of the transistor,relaysandvacuum tubes(thermionic tubes) were commonly used as switching elements;[32][33]a useful computer requires thousands or tens of thousands of switching devices. The overall speed of a system is dependent on the speed of the switches.Vacuum-tube computerssuch as EDVAC tended to average eight hours between failures, whereas relay computers—such as the slower but earlierHarvard Mark I—failed very rarely.[13]In the end, tube-based CPUs became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded generally outweighed the reliability problems. Most of these early synchronous CPUs ran at lowclock ratescompared to modern microelectronic designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100kHzto 4 MHz were very common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with.[34]

The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated the building of smaller and more reliable electronic devices. The first such improvement came with the advent of thetransistor. Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky, unreliable, and fragile switching elements, likevacuum tubesandrelays.[35]With this improvement, more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or severalprinted circuit boardscontaining discrete (individual) components.

In 1964,IBMintroduced itsIBM System/360computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speeds and performances.[36]This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate this improvement, IBM used the concept of amicroprogram(often called "microcode"), which still sees widespread use in modern CPUs.[37]The System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated themainframe computermarket for decades and left a legacy that is continued by similar modern computers like the IBMzSeries.[38][39]In 1965,Digital Equipment Corporation(DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets—thePDP-8.[40]

Transistor-based computers had several distinct advantages over their predecessors. Aside from facilitating increased reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a transistor in comparison to a tube or relay.[41]The increased reliability and dramatically increased speed of the switching elements, which were almost exclusively transistors by this time; CPU clock rates in the tens of megahertz were easily obtained during this period.[42]Additionally, while discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance designs likesingle instruction, multiple data(SIMD)vector processorsbegan to appear.[43]These early experimental designs later gave rise to the era of specializedsupercomputerslike those made byCray IncandFujitsu Ltd.[43]

During this period, a method of manufacturing many interconnected transistors in a compact space was developed. Theintegrated circuit(IC) allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a singlesemiconductor-baseddie, or "chip". At first, only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such asNOR gateswere miniaturized into ICs.[44]CPUs based on these "building block" ICs are generally referred to as "small-scale integration" (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, such as the ones used in theApollo Guidance Computer, usually contained up to a few dozen transistors. To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than earlier discrete transistor designs.[45]

IBM'sSystem/370, follow-on to the System/360, used SSI ICs rather thanSolid Logic Technologydiscrete-transistor modules.[46][47]DEC'sPDP-8/I and KI10PDP-10also switched from the individual transistors used by the PDP-8 and KA PDP-10 to SSI ICs,[48]and their extremely popularPDP-11line was originally built with SSI ICs, but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became practical.

Lee Boyselpublished influential articles, including a 1967 "manifesto", which described how to build the equivalent of a 32-bit mainframe computer from a relatively small number oflarge-scale integrationcircuits (LSI).[49][50]The only way to build LSI chips, which are chips with a hundred or more gates, was to build them using ametal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS)semiconductor manufacturing process(eitherPMOS logic,NMOS logic, orCMOSlogic). However, some companies continued to build processors out of bipolartransistor–transistor logic(TTL) chips because bipolar junction transistors were faster than MOS chips up until the 1970s (a few companies such asDatapointcontinued to build processors out of TTL chips until the early 1980s).[50]In the 1960s, MOS ICs were slower and initially considered useful only in applications that required low power.[51][52]Following the development ofsilicon-gateMOS technology byFederico Fagginat Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, MOS ICs largely replaced bipolar TTL as the standard chip technology in the late 1970s.[53]

As themicroelectronictechnology advanced, an increasing number of transistors were placed on ICs, decreasing the number of individual ICs needed for a complete CPU. MSI and LSI ICs increased transistor counts to hundreds, and then thousands. By 1968, the number of ICs required to build a complete CPU had been reduced to 24 ICs of eight different types, with each IC containing roughly 1000 MOSFETs.[54]In stark contrast with its SSI and MSI predecessors, the first LSI implementation of the PDP-11 contained a CPU composed of only four LSI integrated circuits.[55]

Since microprocessors were first introduced they have almost completely overtaken all other central processing unit implementation methods. The first commercially available microprocessor, made in 1971, was theIntel 4004. The Intel 4004 was one of the first consumer-facing CPU integratingarithmetic logic unit,control unit, andregister uniton a chip.[56]The first widely used microprocessor, made in 1974, was theIntel 8080. Mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers of the time launched proprietary IC development programs to upgrade their oldercomputer architectures, and eventually producedinstruction setcompatible microprocessors that were backward-compatible with their older hardware and software. Combined with the advent and eventual success of the ubiquitouspersonal computer, the termCPUis now applied almost exclusively[a]to microprocessors. Several CPUs (denotedcores) can be combined in a single processing chip.[57]

Previous generations of CPUs were implemented asdiscrete componentsand numerous smallintegrated circuits(ICs) on one or more circuit boards.[58]Microprocessors, on the other hand, are CPUs manufactured on a very small number of ICs; usually just one.[59]The overall smaller CPU size, as a result of being implemented on a single die, means faster switching time because of physical factors like decreased gateparasitic capacitance.[60][61]This has allowed synchronous microprocessors to have clock rates ranging from tens of megahertz to several gigahertz. Additionally, the ability to construct exceedingly small transistors on an IC has increased the complexity and number of transistors in a single CPU many fold. This widely observed trend is described byMoore's law, which had proven to be a fairly accurate predictor of the growth of CPU (and other IC) complexity until 2016.[62][63]

While the complexity, size, construction and general form of CPUs have changed enormously since 1950,[64]the basic design and function has not changed much at all. Almost all common CPUs today can be very accurately described as von Neumann stored-program machines.[65][b]As Moore's law no longer holds, concerns have arisen about the limits of integrated circuit transistor technology. Extreme miniaturization ofelectronic gatesis causing the effects of phenomena likeelectromigrationandsubthreshold leakageto become much more significant.[67][68]These newer concerns are among the many factors causing researchers to investigate new methods of computing such as thequantum computer, as well as to expand the use ofparallelismand other methods that extend the usefulness of the classical von Neumann model.

The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a sequence of storedinstructionsthat is called a program. The instructions to be executed are kept in some kind ofcomputer memory. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as theinstruction cycle.

Random-access memory(RAM;/ræm/) is a form ofelectronic computer memorythat can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store workingdataandmachine code.[1][2]Arandom-accessmemory device allows data items to bereador written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such ashard disksandmagnetic tape), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

In modern technology, random-access memory takes the form ofintegrated circuit(IC) chips withMOS(metal–oxide–semiconductor)memory cells. RAM is normally associated withvolatiletypes of memory where stored information is lost if power is removed. The two main types of volatile random-accesssemiconductor memoryarestatic random-access memory(SRAM) anddynamic random-access memory(DRAM).

Non-volatile RAM has also been developed[3]and other types ofnon-volatile memoriesallow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations. These include most types ofROMandNOR flash memory.

The use of semiconductor RAM dates back to 1965 when IBM introduced the monolithic (single-chip) 16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for theirSystem/360 Model 95computer, andToshibaused bipolar DRAM memory cells for its 180-bit Toscal BC-1411electronic calculator, both based onbipolar transistors. While it offered higher speeds thanmagnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.[4]In 1966, Dr.Robert Dennardinvented modern DRAM architecture in which there's a single MOS transistor per capacitor.[5]The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1KIntel 1103, was introduced in October 1970.Synchronous dynamic random-access memory(SDRAM) was reintroduced with theSamsungKM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

Early computers usedrelays,mechanical counters[6]ordelay linesfor main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines wereserial deviceswhich could only reproduce data in the order it was written.Drum memorycould be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items requires knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out oftriode vacuum tubes, and later, out ofdiscrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such asregisters. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally, only a few dozen or few hundredbitsof such memory could be provided.

The first practical form of random-access memory was theWilliams tube. It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of acathode-ray tube. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at theUniversity of Manchesterin England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in theManchester Babycomputer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June, 1948.[7]In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was atestbedto demonstrate the reliability of the memory.[8][9]

Magnetic-core memorywas invented in 1947 and developed up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings. By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible. Magnetic core memory was the standard form ofcomputer memoryuntil displaced bysemiconductor memoryinintegrated circuits(ICs) during the early 1970s.[10]

Prior to the development of integratedread-only memory(ROM) circuits,permanent(orread-only) random-access memory was often constructed usingdiode matricesdriven byaddress decoders, or specially woundcore rope memoryplanes.[citation needed]

Semiconductor memoryappeared in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which usedbipolar transistors. Although it was faster, it could not compete with the lower price of magnetic core memory.[11]

In 1957, Frosch and Derick manufactured the first silicon dioxide field-effect transistors at Bell Labs, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface.[12]Subsequently, in 1960, a team demonstrated a workingMOSFETat Bell Labs.[13][14]This led to the development ofmetal–oxide–semiconductor(MOS) memory by John Schmidt atFairchild Semiconductorin 1964.[10][15]In addition to higher speeds, MOSsemiconductor memorywas cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory.[10]The development ofsilicon-gateMOS integrated circuit(MOS IC) technology byFederico Fagginat Fairchild in 1968 enabled the production of MOSmemory chips.[16]MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s.[10]

Integrated bipolarstatic random-access memory(SRAM) was invented by Robert H. Norman atFairchild Semiconductorin 1963.[17]It was followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964.[10]SRAM became an alternative to magnetic-core memory, but required six MOS transistors for each bit of data.[18]Commercial use of SRAM began in 1965, whenIBMintroduced the SP95 memory chip for theSystem/360 Model 95.[11]

Dynamic random-access memory(DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4- or 6-transistor latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly increasing memory density at the cost of volatility. Data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor and had to be periodicallyrefreshedevery few milliseconds before the charge could leak away.

Toshiba's Toscal BC-1411electronic calculator, which was introduced in 1965,[19][20][21]used a form of capacitor bipolar DRAM, storing 180-bit data on discretememory cells, consisting ofgermaniumbipolar transistors and capacitors.[20][21]Capacitors had also been used for earlier memory schemes, such as the drum of theAtanasoff–Berry Computer, theWilliams tubeand theSelectron tube. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory.[22]

In 1966,Robert Dennard, while examining the characteristics of MOS technology, found it was capable of buildingcapacitors, and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit, and the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor. This led to his development of modern DRAM architecture for which there is a single MOS transistor per capacitor.[18]In 1967, Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a single-transistor DRAM memory cell, based on MOS technology.[18][23]The first commercial DRAM IC chip was theIntel 1103, which wasmanufacturedon an8μmMOS process with a capacity of 1kbit, and was released in 1970.[10][24][25]

The earliest DRAMs were often synchronized with the CPU clock and were used with early microprocessors. In the mid-1970s, DRAMs moved to the asynchronous design, but in the 1990s returned to synchronous operation.[26][27]In 1992 Samsung released KM48SL2000, which had a capacity of 16Mbit.[28][29]The first commercialdouble data rateSDRAM was Samsung's 64MbitDDR SDRAM, released in June 1998.[30]GDDR(graphics DDR) is a form ofSGRAM(synchronous graphics RAM), which was first released by Samsung as a 16Mbit memory chip in 1998.[31]

In general, the termRAMrefers solely to solid-state memory devices, and more specifically the main memory in most computers. The two widely used forms of modern RAM arestatic RAM(SRAM) anddynamic RAM(DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of amemory cell, typically using six MOSFETs. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less static power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used ascache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor andcapacitorpair (typically a MOSFET andMOS capacitor, respectively),[32]which together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.

Both static and dynamic RAM are consideredvolatile, as their state is lost when power is removed from the system. By contrast,read-only memory(ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered. Writable variants of ROM (such asEEPROMandNOR flash) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data topersistwithout power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.

ECC memory(which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, usingparity bitsorerror correction codes.

The memory cell is the fundamental building block ofcomputer memory. The memory cell is anelectronic circuitthat stores one bit of binary information. The cell can be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

Article: Solid-state drive

Asolid-state drive(SSD) is a type ofsolid-state storagedevice that usesintegrated circuitsto store datapersistently. It is sometimes calledsemiconductor storage device,solid-state device, orsolid-state disk.[1][2]

SSDs rely on non-volatile memory, typicallyNAND flash, to store data in memory cells. The performance and endurance of SSDs vary depending on the number of bits stored per cell, ranging from high-performing single-level cells (SLC) to more affordable but slower quad-level cells (QLC). In addition to flash-based SSDs, other technologies such as3D XPointoffer faster speeds and higher endurance through different data storage mechanisms.

Unlike traditionalhard disk drives(HDDs), SSDs have no moving parts, allowing them to deliver faster data access speeds, reduced latency, increased resistance to physical shock, lower power consumption, and silent operation.

Often interfaced to a system in the same way as HDDs, SSDs are used in a variety of devices, includingpersonal computers,enterprise servers, andmobile devices. However, SSDs are generally more expensive on a per-gigabyte basis and have a finite number of write cycles, which can lead to data loss over time. Despite these limitations, SSDs are increasingly replacing HDDs, especially in performance-critical applications and as primary storage in many consumer devices.

SSDs come in various form factors and interface types, includingSATA,PCIe, andNVMe, each offering different levels of performance. Hybrid storage solutions, such assolid-state hybrid drives(SSHDs), combine SSD and HDD technologies to offer improved performance at a lower cost than pure SSDs.

An SSD stores data insemiconductorcells, with its properties varying according to the number ofbitsstored in each cell (between 1 and 4). Single-level cells (SLC) store one bit of data per cell and provide higher performance and endurance. In contrast, multi-level cells (MLC), triple-level cells (TLC), and quad-level cells (QLC) store more data per cell but have lower performance and endurance. SSDs using3D XPointtechnology, such as Intel's Optane, store data by changing electrical resistance instead of storing electrical charges in cells, which can provide faster speeds and longer data persistence compared to conventional flash memory.[3]SSDs based onNAND flashslowly leak charge when not powered, while heavily used consumer drives may start losing data typically after one to two years unpowered in storage.[4]SSDs have a limited lifetime number of writes, and also slow down as they reach their full storage capacity.[citation needed]

SSDs also have internal parallelism that allows them to manage multiple operations simultaneously, which enhances their performance.[5]

Unlike HDDs and similarelectromechanicalmagnetic storage, SSDs do not have moving mechanical parts, which provides advantages such as resistance to physical shock, quieter operation, and faster access times. Their lower latency results in higher input/output rates (IOPS) than HDDs.[6]

Some SSDs are combined with traditional hard drives in hybrid configurations, such as Intel'sHystorand Apple'sFusion Drive. These drives use both flash memory and spinning magnetic disks in order to improve the performance of frequently accessed data.[7][8]

Traditional interfaces (e.g.SATAandSAS) andstandard HDD form factorsallow such SSDs to be used as drop-in replacements for HDDs in computers and other devices. Newer form factors such asmSATA,M.2,U.2,NF1/M.3/NGSFF,[9][10]XFM Express(Crossover Flash Memory, form factor XT2)[11]andEDSFF[12][13]and higher speed interfaces such asNVM Express(NVMe) overPCI Express(PCIe) can further increase performance over HDD performance.[3]

Traditional HDDbenchmarkstend to focus on the performance characteristics such asrotational latencyandseek time. As SSDs do not need to spin or seek to locate data, they are vastly superior to HDDs in such tests. However, SSDs have challenges with mixed reads and writes, and their performance may degrade over time. Therefore, SSD testing typically looks at when the full drive is first used, as the new and empty drive may have much better write performance than it would show after only weeks of use.[14]

The reliability of both HDDs and SSDs varies greatly among models.[15]Some field failure rates indicate that SSDs are significantly more reliable than HDDs.[16][17]However, SSDs are sensitive to sudden power interruption, sometimes resulting in aborted writes or even cases of the complete loss of the drive.[18]

Most of the advantages of solid-state drives over traditional hard drives are due to their ability to access data completely electronically instead of electromechanically, resulting in superior transfer speeds and mechanical ruggedness.[19]On the other hand, hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity for their price.[6][20]

In traditional HDDs, a rewritten file will generally occupy the same location on the disk surface as the original file, whereas in SSDs the new copy will often be written to different NAND cells for the purpose ofwear leveling. The wear-leveling algorithms are complex and difficult to test exhaustively. As a result, one major cause of data loss in SSDs is firmware bugs.[21][22]

While bothmemory cardsand most SSDs use flash memory, they have very different characteristics, including power consumption, performance, size, and reliability. Originally, solid state drives were shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. In contrast, memory cards (such asSecure Digital(SD),CompactFlash(CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.[40]

SSDs have differentfailure modesfrom traditional magnetic hard drives. Because solid-state drives contain no moving parts, they are generally not subject to mechanical failures. However, other types of failures can occur. For example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power loss may be more problematic than with HDDs, and the failure of a single chip may result in the loss of all data stored on it. Nonetheless, studies indicate that SSDs are generally reliable, often exceed their manufacturer-stated lifespan[41][42]and have lower failure rates than HDDs.[41]However, studies also note that SSDs experience higher rates of uncorrectable errors, which can lead to data loss, compared to HDDs.[43]

Manufacturers often calculate DW/D and TBW with worse conditions than those present in most real situations, such as the host operating system not supporting or having disabled support for4 KB sector alignmentorTRIM.[45]For example, aSamsung 970 EVO NVMe M.2SSD (2018) with 1 TB of capacity has an endurance rating of 600 TBW.[46]

Recovering data from SSDs presents challenges due to the non-linear and complex nature of data storage in solid-state drives. The internal operations of SSDs vary by manufacturer, with commands (e.g.TRIMand the ATA Secure Erase) and programs like (e.g.hdparm) being able to erase and modify the bits of a deleted file.

Article: Hard disk drive

Ahard disk drive(HDD),hard disk,hard drive, orfixed disk[a]is an electro-mechanicaldata storage devicethat stores and retrievesdigital datausingmagnetic storagewith one or more rigid rapidly rotatingplatterscoated with magnetic material. The platters are paired withmagnetic heads, usually arranged on a movingactuatorarm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[1]Data is accessed in arandom-accessmanner, meaning that individualblocksof data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type ofnon-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off.[2][3][4]Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box, possibly in adisk enclosurefor portability.

Hard disk drives were introduced byIBMin 1956,[5]and were the dominantsecondary storagedevice forgeneral-purpose computersbeginning in the early 1960s. HDDs maintained this position into the modern era ofserversandpersonal computers, though personal computing devices produced in large volume, likemobile phonesandtablets, rely onflash memorystorage devices. More than 224 companies haveproduced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation, most units are manufactured bySeagate,Toshiba, andWestern Digital. HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced (exabytesper year) for servers. Though production is growing slowly (by exabytes shipped[6]), sales revenues and unit shipments are declining, becausesolid-state drives(SSDs) have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal storage density, somewhat better reliability,[7][8]and much lower latency and access times.[9][10][11][12]

The revenues for SSDs, most of which useNAND flash memory, slightly exceeded those for HDDs in 2018.[13]Flash storage products had more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of 2017[update].[14]Though SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit,[15][16]they are replacing HDDs in applications where speed, power consumption, small size, high capacity and durability are important.[11][12]As of 2017[update], the cost per bit of SSDs was falling, and the price premium over HDDs had narrowed.[16]

The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity andperformance. Capacity is specified inunit prefixescorresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte(TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000gigabytes, where 1 gigabyte = 1 000 megabytes = 1 000 000 kilobytes (1 million) = 1 000 000 000bytes(1 billion). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by thefile systemand the computeroperating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery. There can be confusion regarding storage capacity since capacities are stated in decimal gigabytes (powers of 1000) by HDD manufacturers, whereas the most commonly used operating systems report capacities in powers of 1024, which results in a smaller number than advertised. Performance is specified as the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time), the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (averagelatency, which is a function of the physicalrotational speedinrevolutions per minute), and finally, the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).

The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops and servers. HDDs are connected to systems by standardinterfacecables such asSATA(Serial ATA),USB, SAS (Serial Attached SCSI), orPATA(Parallel ATA) cables.

The first production IBM hard disk drive, the350 disk storage, shipped in 1957 as a component of the IBM 305 RAMAC system. It was approximately the size of two large refrigerators and stored five million six-bit characters (3.75megabytes)[18]on a stack of 52 disks (100 surfaces used).[28]The 350 had a single arm with two read/write heads, one facing up and the other down, that moved both horizontally between a pair of adjacent platters and vertically from one pair of platters to a second set.[29][30][31]Variants of the IBM 350 were theIBM 355,IBM 7300andIBM 1405.

In 1961, IBM announced, and in 1962 shipped, the IBM 1301 disk storage unit,[32]which superseded the IBM 350 and similar drives. The 1301 consisted of one (for Model 1) or two (for model 2) modules, each containing 25 platters, each platter about1⁄8-inch (3.2 mm) thick and 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter.[33]While the earlier IBM disk drives used only two read/write heads per arm, the 1301 used an array of 48[l]heads (comb), each array moving horizontally as a single unit, one head per surface used.Cylinder-moderead/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6 μm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three large refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes per module. Access time was about a quarter of a second.

Also in 1962, IBM introduced themodel 1311disk drive, which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removabledisk pack. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels ofmagnetic tape. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called "fixed disk" drives.

In 1963, IBM introduced the 1302,[34]with twice the track capacity and twice as many tracks per cylinder as the 1301. The 1302 had one (for Model 1) or two (for Model 2) modules, each containing a separate comb for the first 250 tracks and the last 250 tracks.

Some high-performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track, e.g., the Burroughs B-475 in 1964 and theIBM 2305in 1970, so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track and the only latency was the time for the desired block of data to rotate into position under the head.[35]Known as fixed-head or head-per-track disk drives, they were very expensive and are no longer in production.[36]

In 1973, IBM introduced a new type of HDD code-named "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to "land" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, "taking off" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of "Winchester technology" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later "Winchester" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.

In 1974, IBM introduced the swinging arm actuator, made feasible because the Winchester recording heads function well when skewed to the recorded tracks. The simple design of the IBM GV (Gulliver) drive,[37]invented at IBM's UK Hursley Labs, became IBM's most licensed electro-mechanical invention[38]of all time, the actuator and filtration system being adopted in the 1980s eventually for all HDDs, and still universal nearly 40 years and 10 billion arms later.

Like the first removable pack drive, the first "Winchester" drives used platters 14 inches (360 mm) in diameter. In 1978, IBM introduced a swing arm drive, the IBM 0680 (Piccolo), with eight-inch platters, exploring the possibility that smaller platters might offer advantages. Other eight-inch drives followed, then5+1⁄4in (130 mm) drives, sized to replace the contemporaryfloppy disk drives. The latter were primarily intended for the then fledgling personal computer (PC) market.

Over time, as recording densities were greatly increased, further reductions in disk diameter to 3.5" and 2.5" were found to be optimum. Powerful rare-earth magnet materials became affordable during this period and were complementary to the swing arm actuator design to make possible the compact form factors of modern HDDs.

As the 1980s began, HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs, but by the late 1980s, their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers.

Most HDDs in the early 1980s were sold to PC end users as an external, add-on subsystem. The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer's name but under the subsystem manufacturer's name such asCorvus SystemsandTallgrass Technologies, or under the PC system manufacturer's name such as theApple ProFile. TheIBM PC/XTin 1983 included an internal 10 MB HDD, and soon thereafter, internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers.

External HDDs remained popular for much longer on theApple Macintosh. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured aSCSIport on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, theMacintosh 128K,Macintosh 512K, andMacintosh Plusdid not feature a hard drive bay at all), so on those models, external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.

HDD improvements have been driven by increasingareal density, listed in the table above. Applications expanded through the 2000s, from themainframe computersof the late 1950s to mostmass storageapplications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content.

In the 2000s and 2010s, NAND began supplanting HDDs in applications requiring portability or high performance. NAND performance is improving faster than HDDs, and applications for HDDs are eroding. In 2018, the largest hard drive had a capacity of 15 TB, while the largest capacity SSD had a capacity of 100 TB.[39]In 2018, HDDs were forecast to reach 100 TB capacities around 2025 (but so far in 2025 the reality is far off),[40]but as of 2019[update], the expected pace of improvement was pared back to 50 TB by 2026.[41]Smaller form factors, 1.8-inches and below, were discontinued around 2010. The cost of solid-state storage (NAND), represented byMoore's law, is improving faster than HDDs. NAND has a higherprice elasticity of demandthan HDDs, and this drives market growth.[42]During the late 2000s and 2010s, theproduct life cycleof HDDs entered a mature phase, and slowing sales may indicate the onset of the declining phase.[43]

Article: Motherboard

Amotherboard, also called amainboard, asystem board, alogic board, and informally amobo(see"Nomenclature" section), is the mainprinted circuit board(PCB) ingeneral-purpose computersand other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as thecentral processing unit(CPU) andmemory, and provides connectors for otherperipherals.

Unlike abackplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the CPU, thechipset'sinput/outputandmemory controllers,interfaceconnectors, and other components integrated for general use.[1]: 48

Oxford English Dictionarytraces the origin of the wordmotherboardto 1965, its earliest-found attestation occurring in the magazineElectronics.[2]The term alludes to its importance and size compared to the components attached to it, being the "mother of all boards" in a computer system.[3]

Several alternative terms formotherboardhave been used in technical documentation and industry practice, includingmainboard,system board,logic board,baseboard, and the informalmobo. These terms are functionally synonymous and reflect regional, corporate, or contextual preferences rather than a coordinated effort to adopt gender-neutral language.[citation needed]

System boardwas used byIBMin documentation for theIBM PCand its derivatives; however, higher-end models in thePS/2line, such as theModel 80, used the termplanarinstead.Applecommonly useslogic boardin its technical documentation for products such as theApple IIand theMac.Inteltypically usesbaseboardin its technical manuals, though it also usesmotherboardinterchangeably.[1]The termmobois an informal truncation ofmotherboard, popularized by computer enthusiasts and builders in the 1990s.[4]

The termmainboardsometimes describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards inlaser printers,televisionsets,washing machines,mobile phones, and otherembedded systemswith limited expansion abilities.[citation needed]

Before the advent of themicroprocessor, thecentral processing unit(CPU) of acomputerwas typically implemented using multipleprinted circuit boardshoused in a card cage, interconnected via abackplane—a board containing sockets into which the individual circuit boards were inserted. Early systems used discrete copper wiring between connector pins, but printed circuit boards quickly became the standard. The CPU,main memory, andperipheralcomponents were each located on separate boards connected through the backplane.

With the rise of microprocessors, CPU functionality and supporting circuitry were consolidated onto a single board, while memory and peripherals remained on separate expansion cards plugged into the backplane. A prominent example is theS-100 bus, widely used in 1970s microcomputer systems such as theAltair 8800.

In the 1980s, popular personal computers like theApple IIandIBM Personal Computerfeatured publicly available schematic diagrams and technical documentation[5][6]. This openness enabled rapidreverse engineeringand the development of third-party motherboards. These clone and upgrade boards often provided enhanced performance or additional features, and were commonly used to modernize or replace original manufacturer hardware.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to include single ICs (also calledSuper I/Ochips) capable of supporting a set of low-speed peripherals:PS/2keyboardandmouse,floppy disk drive,serial ports, andparallel ports. By the late 1990s, many personal computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video, storage, and networking functions without the need for anyexpansion cardsat all; higher-end systems for3Dgaming andcomputer graphicstypically retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs, workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had fewer embedded components.

Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century (like thetablet computerand thenetbook). Memory, processors, network controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some systems.

A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains thecentral processing unitand hosts other subsystems and devices.

A typicaldesktop computerhas itsmicroprocessor,main memory, and other essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such asexternal storage, controllers forvideodisplay andsound, and peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or via cables; in modern microcomputers, it is increasingly common to integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself.

An important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor's supportingchipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the variousbusesand external components. This chipset determines, to an extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.

Additionally, nearly all motherboards include logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such asUSBformouse devicesandkeyboards. Earlypersonal computerssuch as theApple IIandIBM PCinclude only this minimal peripheral support on the motherboard. Video interface hardware was also occasionally integrated into the motherboard; for example, on the Apple II. It was even less common on IBM-compatible computers, such as theIBM PCjr. Additional peripherals such asdisk controllersandserial portswere provided as expansion cards.

Given the highthermal design powerof high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always includeheat sinksand mounting points forfansto dissipate excess heat.

Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes calledform factors, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit variouscasesizes. As of 2024[update], mostdesktop computermotherboards use theATXstandard form factor — even those found inMacintoshandSuncomputers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case's motherboard andpower supply unit(PSU) form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate amicroATXmotherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized, and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard.

ACPU socket(central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component that attaches to aprinted circuit board(PCB) and is designed to house a CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most desktop andserver computers(laptops typically use surface mount CPUs), particularly those based on theIntel x86architecture. A CPU socket type and motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.

Apower supply unit(PSU) convertsmains ACto low-voltage regulatedDC powerfor the internal components of adesktop computer. Modern personal computers universally useswitched-mode power supplies. Somepower supplieshave a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the main voltage.

Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to theATX specification, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5-voltstandby (5VSB) power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered. ATX power supplies are turned on and off by a signal from themotherboard. They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages are in spec, so that the computer is able to safely power up and boot. The most recent ATX PSU standard is version 3.1 as of mid 2025.[1]

The desktop computer power supply converts thealternating current(AC) from awall socketofmains electricityto a low-voltagedirect current(DC) to operate the motherboard, processor and peripheral devices. Several direct-current voltages are required, and they must be regulated with some accuracy to provide stable operation of the computer. Apower supply railorvoltage railrefers to a single voltage provided by a PSU.[2]

Some PSUs can also supply astandby voltage, so that most of thecomputersystem can be powered off after preparing for hibernation or shutdown, and powered back on by an event. Standby power allows a computer to be started remotely viawake-on-LANandWake-on-ringor locally via Keyboard Power ON (KBPO) if the motherboard supports it. This standby voltage may be generated by a small linear power supply inside the unit or a switching power supply, sharing some components with the main unit to save cost and energy.

First-generationmicrocomputerandhome computerpower supply units used a heavy step-downtransformerand a linear power supply, as used, in for example, theCommodore PETintroduced in 1977. TheApple II, also introduced in 1977, was noted for itsswitched-mode power supply, which was lighter and smaller than an equivalent linear power supply would have been, and which had no cooling fan.  The switched-mode supply uses aferrite-coredhigh frequencytransformer and power transistors that switch thousands of times per second. By adjusting the switching time of the transistor, the output voltage can be closely controlled without dissipating energy as heat in a linear regulator. The development of high-power and high-voltage transistors at economical prices made it practical to introduce switched-mode supplies that had been used in aerospace, mainframes, minicomputers and color television, into desktop personal computers. TheApple IIdesign byAtariengineerRod Holtwas awarded a patent,[3][4]and was in the vanguard of modern computer power supply design. Now all modern computers use switched-mode power supplies, which are lighter, less costly, and more efficient than equivalent linear power supplies.

Computer power supplies may have short circuit protection, overpower (overload) protection, over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, over-current protection, and over-temperature protection.

Power supplies designed for worldwide use were once equipped with an input voltage selector switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid. In the lower voltage range, around 115 V, this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler inDelon circuitdesign. As a result, the large primaryfilter capacitorbehind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series, balanced withbleeder resistorsandvaristorsthat were necessary in the upper input voltage range, around 230 V. Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher-voltage grid usually resulted in immediate permanent damage. When apower-factor correction(PFC) was required, those filter capacitors were replaced with higher-capacity ones, together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current. This is the simple design of a passive PFC.

Active PFC is more complex and can achieve higher PF, up to 99%. The first active PFC circuits just delayed the inrush. Newer ones work as an input and output condition-controlled step-up converter, supplying a single 400 V filter capacitor from a wide-range input source, usually between 80 and 240 V. Newer PFC circuits also replace theNTC-based inrush current limiter, which is an expensive part previously located next to the fuse.

The firstIBM PCpower supply unit (PSU) supplied two main voltages: +5Vand +12 V. It supplied two other voltages, −5 V and −12 V, but with limited amounts of power. Mostmicrochipsof the time operated on 5 V power. Of the 63.5Wthese PSUs could deliver, most of it was on this +5 V rail.

The +12 V supply was used primarily to operate motors such as in disk drives and cooling fans. As more peripherals were added, more power was delivered on the 12 V rail. However, since most of the power is consumed by chips, the 5 V rail still delivered most of the power. The −12 V rail was used primarily to provide the negative supply voltage to theRS-232serial ports. A −5 V rail was provided for peripherals on the ISA bus (such as soundcards), but was not used by any motherboard other than the original IBM PC motherboard.

An additional wire referred to as 'Power Good' is used to prevent digital circuitry operation during the initial milliseconds of power supply turn-on, where output voltages and currents are rising but not yet sufficient or stable for proper device operation. Once the output power is ready to use, the Power Good signal tells the digital circuitry that it can begin to operate.

Original IBM power supplies for the PC (model 5150),XTandATincluded a line-voltage power switch that extended through the side of the computer case. In a common variant found intowercases, the line-voltage switch was connected to the power supply with a short cable, allowing it to be mounted apart from the power supply.

An early microcomputer power supply was either fully on or off, controlled by the mechanical line-voltage switch, and energy saving low-power idle modes were not a design consideration of early computer power supplies. These power supplies were generally not capable of power saving modes such as standby or "soft off", or scheduled turn-on power controls.

Due to the always-on design, in the event of ashort circuit, either a fuse would blow, or a switched-mode supply would repeatedly cut the power, wait a brief period of time, and attempt to restart. For some power supplies the repeated restarting is audible as a quiet rapid chirping or ticking emitted from the device.

WhenInteldeveloped theATXstandard power supply connector (published in 1995), microchips operating on 3.3 V were becoming more popular, beginning with theIntel 80486DX4microprocessor in 1994, and the ATX standard supplies three positive rails: +3.3 V, +5 V, and +12 V. Earlier computers requiring 3.3 V typically derived that from a simple but inefficientlinear regulatorconnected to the +5 V rail.

The ATX connector provides multiple wires and power connections for the 3.3 V supply, because it is most sensitive tovoltage dropin the supply connections. Another ATX addition was the +5 V SB (standby) rail for providing a small amount ofstandby power, even when the computer was nominally "off".

There are two basic differences betweenATand ATX power supplies: the connectors that provide power to the motherboard, and the soft switch. In ATX-style systems, the front-panel power switch provides only a control signal to the power supply and does not switch the mains AC voltage. This low-voltage control allows othercomputer hardwareorsoftwareto turn the system on and off.

Since ATX power supplies share both the same dimensions (150 × 86 mm (5.9 × 3.4 in)) and the same mounting layout (four screws arranged on the back side of the unit), with the prior format, there is no major physical difference preventing an AT case from accepting an ATX PSU (or vice versa, if the case can host the power switch needed by an AT PSU), provided that the specific PSU is not too long for the specific case.

As transistors become smaller on chips, it becomes preferable to operate them on lower supply voltages, and the lowest supply voltage is often desired by the densest chip, thecentral processing unit. In order to supply large amounts of low-voltage power to thePentiumand subsequent microprocessors, a special power supply, thevoltage regulator modulebegan to be included onmotherboards. Newer processors may require over 200 A at 1.5 V or less, which is impractical to deliver from off-board power supplies.

Article: Computer case

Acomputer case, also known as acomputer chassis, is theenclosurethat contains most of thehardwareof apersonal computer. The components housed inside the case (such as theCPU,motherboard,memory,mass storagedevices,power supply unitand variousexpansion cards) are referred as theinternalhardware, while hardware outside the case (typicallycable-linked orplug-and-playdevices such as thedisplay,speakers,keyboard,mouseandUSB flash drives) are known asperipherals.

Conventional computer cases are fully enclosed, with small holes (mostly in the back panel) that allowventilationand cutout openings that provide access toplugs/sockets(back) andremovable mediadrive bays(front). Thestructural frame(chassis) of a case is usually constructed from rigidmetalssuch assteel(oftenSECC— steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil) andaluminium alloy, withhardpointsandthrough holesfor mounting internal hardware,case fans/coolersand for organizingcable management. The external case panels, at least one of which are removable, cover the chassis from the front, sides and top to shield the internal components from physical intrusion anddustcollection, and are typically made from painted metallic and/orplasticmaterial, while other materials such asmesh,tempered glass,acrylic,woodand evenLego brickshave appeared in many modern commercial orhome-built cases. In recent years,open frameoropen aircases that are only partly enclosed (with freer ventilation and thus theoretically bettercooling) have become available in the premiumgaming PCmarket.

Cases can come in many different sizes and shapes, which are usually determined by theform factorof themotherboardsince it is physically the largest hardware component in most computers. Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only theinternaldimensions and layout of the case. Form factors forrack-mountedandblade serversmay include preciseexternaldimensions as well since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.

For example, a case designed for anATXmotherboard andpower supply unit(PSU) may take on several external forms such as a verticaltower(designed to sit on the floor, height > width), a flatdesktop(height < width) orpizza box(height ≤ 5 cm or 2 in) designed to sit on the desk under the computer'smonitor). Full-size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room fordrive bays,expansion slots, and custom or all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. Desktop cases—andmini-towercases under about 46 cm (18 in) high—are popular in business environments where space is at a premium.[1]

Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX,[citation needed]althoughmicroATXandsmall form factorshave also become very popular for a variety of uses. In the high-end segment, the unofficial and loosely defined XL-ATX specification appeared around 2009. It extends the length of the mainboard to accommodate four graphics cards with dual-slot coolers. Some XL-ATX mainboards increase the mainboard's width as well, to allow more space for the CPU, Memory PWM, and in some cases, a second CPU socket. While the market share of these exotic high-end mainboards is very low, almost all high-end cases and many mainstream cases support XL-ATX (10 expansion slots). As of 2018, no major motherboard manufacturer has made an XL-ATX board for several years. E-ATX is similar to XL-ATX in that it is larger than ATX and is also loosely defined. Unlike XL-ATX, E-ATX motherboards and cases are still in production (as of 2020), and support quad-channel memory across 8 slots of ram, up to 4 PCI-e expansion slots for up to 4 double slot graphics cards and a single CPU such as the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X.[2][3][4][5][6]Companies likeIn Win Development,Shuttle Inc.andAOpenoriginally popularized small cases, for whichFlexATXwas the most common[dubious–discuss]motherboard size. As of 2010Mini ITXhas widely replacedFlexATXas the most common small form factor mainboard standard. The latest mini ITX mainboards fromAsus,Gigabyte,MSI,ASRock,ZotacandFoxconnoffer the same feature set as full size mainboards. High-end mini ITX mainboards support standard desktop CPUs, use standard memory DIMM sockets, and mostly feature a full-size PCI-E 16× slot with support for the fastest graphics cards, although some instead use a PCI, or PCIe slot of fewer than 16 lanes. This allows customers to build a fully-fledged high-end computer in a significantly smaller case.Apple Inc.has also produced theMac Minicomputer, which is similar in size to a standard CD-ROM drive, and many manufacturers offer mini-ITX cases of similar size for low-wattage CPUs with integrated graphics.

Tower cases are often categorized as mini-tower, midi-tower, mid-tower, or full-tower. The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers.

Full tower casesare typically 56 cm (22 in) or more in height and intended to stand on the floor. They can have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays. These cases were originally developed to housefile serverswhich would typically be tasked with serving data from expensive CD-ROM databases that held more data than the hard drives commonly available at the time. Hence, many full tower cases include locking doors and other physical security features to prevent theft of the discs. However, as computing technology moves fromfloppy disksandCD-ROMsto large capacity hard drives,USB flash drives, and network-based solutions, more recent full tower cases typically only have none, one, or two external bays for CD drives, with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to improve airflow. Today, full tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece display cases with custom water cooling, lighting, and tempered glass (replacing acrylic).[7][8][9]They may also hold two computers (as is the case with the Corsair 1000D) and dual power supplies (Corsair 900D).[10][11]

Mid-tower casesare smaller, about 46 cm (18 in) high with two to four external bays. They may also hold two computers.[12]

The marketing termmidi-towersometimes refers to cases smaller than mid-tower but larger than mini-tower, typically with two to three external bays.[14]Other times the term may be synonymous withmid-tower.[15]

Computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for apower supply unitanddrive bays, as well as a rear panel that can accommodateperipheralconnectors protruding from the motherboard andexpansion slots. Most cases also have a power button or switch, areset button, andLEDsto indicate power, hard drive activity, and network activity in some models. Some cases include built-in I/O ports (such asUSBand headphone ports) on the front of the case. Such a case will also (normally) include the wires needed to connect these ports, switches, and indicators to the motherboard.[16]

Accessing the interior components of a modernATXtower case is done by removing the side panels. Looking front-to-back, accessing the motherboard, PSU, drive bays, and most case fan installation points are done by removing the left side panel.
Removing the right-side panel is done less often to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate. This space is devoted to cable management, as cables routed in front of the motherboard may disrupt the flow of air within the case causing increased temperatures.[17]BTX, an uncontemporary standard, has the main side panel on the right side as opposed to the left. Some upside-down designed ATX cases are also accessed by removing the right-side panel door.

Alternatively, the case may have a single large U-shaped cover that saddles the chassis. This was ubiquitous inATtower cases.

To prevent the buildup of performance-degrading dust within the case, many models feature dust filters in front of the air intake fans. While the exact method of accessing the front filters depends on the case model, it usually requires the removal of the entire front panel. Removal of the front panel itself may or may not require the removal of one or both of the side panels. If there is any doubt, consult the user's manual if possible.

Traditionally, most computer cases requiredcomputer case screwsto hold components and panels in place (i.e. motherboard, PSU, drives, and expansion cards). From the early 2000s onwards there is a trend towards tool-less cases, in which components are held together with snap-in plastic rails, thumbscrews, and other methods that do not require tools; this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware and is also cheaper to manufacture.

Throughout the 1990s, most computer cases had simple rectangular shapes, and were often paintedbeigeorwhitewith little attention given to the visual design.Beige boxdesigns are still found on a large number of budget computers assembled from generic components. These class of machines are now known aswhite box computers, even though the cases for these types of machines are now generally colored black or silver instead of beige. More modern computer cases include a much wider range of variation in shape, color, form factor, and materials, such as brushed aluminium and/or tempered glass which are offered with more expensive cases.

Case moddingis the artistic styling of computer cases, often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components. Since the early 2000s, some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating. Modded cases may also include colored internal lighting, custom paint, orliquid cooling systems. Some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum, steel,styrofoam, acrylic, or wood.

Historically, cases used CCFL lighting[18]and eventually single color LEDs as strips or in fans to illuminate their interior; modern cases use RGB LED lighting instead, often incorporated into case fans. To improve airflow while allowing RGB fans to be visible, many cases as of 2020 use metal meshes, without any external bays.[19]Many include a PSU shroud and vertical gpu mounts. Some used to include holes to support external water cooling radiators.[20][21][22][23][24][25]Cases with side windows may have side fans (on the window) as well, although it is uncommon for cases with glass windows to have side fans.[26]

Prominentafter-marketcase manufacturers includeAntec,BitFenix,Cooler Master,Corsair,Fractal Design,In Win Development,Lian Li,NZXT Corp.,Phanteks,Rosewill, andThermaltake, (DIY PC)

Some computer cases include abiased switch(push-button) which connects to the motherboard. When the case is opened, the switch position changes, and the system records this change. The system'sfirmwareorBIOSmay be configured to report this event the next time it is powered on. This physicalintrusion detectionsystem may help computer owners detect tampering with their computers. However, most such systems are quite simple in construction; a knowledgeable intruder can open the case or modify its contents without triggering the switch.

Article: DDR4 SDRAM

Double Data Rate 4 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory(DDR4 SDRAM) is a type ofsynchronous dynamic random-access memorywith a highbandwidth("double data rate") interface.

Released to the market in 2014,[2][3][4]it is a variant ofdynamic random-access memory(DRAM), some of which have been in use since the early 1970s,[5]and a higher-speed successor to theDDR2andDDR3technologies.

DDR4 is not compatible with any earlier type of random-access memory (RAM) due to different signaling voltage and physical interface, besides other factors.

DDR4SDRAMwas released to the public market in Q2 2014, focusing onECC memory,[6]while the non-ECC DDR4 modules became available in Q3 2014, accompanying the launch ofHaswell-Eprocessors that require DDR4 memory.[7]

The primary advantages of DDR4 over its predecessor, DDR3, include higher module density and lower voltage requirements, coupled with higherdata rate transferspeeds. The DDR4 standard allows forDIMMsof up to 64GBin capacity, compared to DDR3's maximum of 16 GB per DIMM.[1][8][failed verification]

Unlike previous generations of DDR memory,prefetchhasnotbeen increased above the 8n used in DDR3;[9]: 16the basic burst size is eight 64-bit words, and higher bandwidths are achieved by sending more read/write commands per second. To allow this, the standard divides the DRAM banks into two or four selectable bank groups,[10]where transfers to different bank groups may be done more rapidly.

Because power consumption increases with speed, the reduced voltage allows higher speed operation without unreasonable power and cooling requirements.

DDR4 RAMoperates at a voltage of1.2 Vand supports frequencies between800 and 1600 MHz(DDR4-1600 through DDR4-3200). Compared to DDR3, which operates at1.5 Vwithfrequenciesfrom400 to 1067 MHz(DDR3-800 through DDR3-2133), DDR4 offers better performance andenergy efficiency. DDR4 speeds are advertised as double the base clock rate due to its Double Data Rate (DDR) nature, with common speeds including DDR4-2400 and DDR4-3200, and higher speeds like DDR4-4266 and DDR4-5000 available at a premium. Unlike DDR3, DDR4 does not have a low voltage variant; it consistently operates at1.2 V. Additionally, DDR4 improves on DDR3 with a longer burst length of 16 and supports larger memory capacities, enhancing both performance and system flexibility.[11][12]

In April 2013, a news writer atInternational Data Group(IDG) – an American technology research business originally part ofIDC– produced an analysis of their perceptions related to DDR4 SDRAM.[41]The conclusions were that the increasing popularity ofmobile computingand other devices using slower but low-powered memory, the slowing of growth in the traditionaldesktop computingsector, and theconsolidationof the memory manufacturing marketplace, meant that margins on RAM were tight.

As a result, the desiredpremium pricingfor the new technology was harder to achieve, and capacity had shifted to other sectors. SDRAM manufacturers and chipset creators were, to an extent, "stuck between a rock and a hard place" where "nobody wants to pay a premium for DDR4 products, and manufacturers don't want to make the memory if they are not going to get a premium", according to Mike Howard from iSuppli.[41]A switch inconsumer sentimenttoward desktop computing and release of processors having DDR4 support byIntelandAMDcould therefore potentially lead to "aggressive" growth.[41]

Intel's 2014Haswellroadmap, revealed the company's first use of DDR4 SDRAM inHaswell-EPprocessors.[42]

DDR4 RAMoperates with a primary supply voltage of1.2 Vand an auxiliary2.5 Vsupply for wordline boosting (VPP). This contrasts withDDR3, which runs at1.5 Vand had lower voltage variants at1.35 Vintroduced in 2013. DDR4 was introduced with a minimum transfer rate of2133 MT/s, influenced by DDR3's nearing limit at similar speeds, and is expected to reach up to4266 MT/s. Notable improvements in DDR4 include increased data transfer rates and enhanced efficiency. Early DDR4 samples, such as those fromSamsungin January 2011, showed a CAS latency of13clock cycles, comparable to the DDR2 to DDR3 transition. Additionally, DDR4 features a longer burst length of 16, higher capacity support, and improvedsignal integritywith tighter pin spacing (0.85 mm vs. 1.0 mm), slightly increased height (31.25 mm vs. 30.35 mm), and increased thickness (1.2 mm vs. 1.0 mm) for better signal routing and performance.

Increased memory density is anticipated, possibly using TSV ("through-silicon via") or other3D stacking processes.[31][37][44][45]The DDR4 specification will include standardized3D stacking"from the start" according to JEDEC,[45]with provision for up to8 stackeddies.[9]: 12X-bit Labs predicted that "as a result DDR4 memory chips with very high density will become relatively inexpensive".[37]

In 2008, the bookWafer Level 3-D ICs Process Technologyhighlighted concerns about the increasing die area consumption due to non-scaling analog elements likecharge pumps,voltage regulators, and additional circuitry. These components, includingCRCerror-detection,on-die termination, burst hardware, programmable pipelines, low impedance, and a greater need forsense amplifiers(driven by reduced bits per bitline due to lower voltage), have significantly increased bandwidth but at the cost of occupying more die area. Consequently, the proportion of die allocated to the memory array itself has decreased over time: from70–78%for SDRAM and DDR1 to47%for DDR2,38%for DDR3, and potentially less than30%for DDR4.[46]

The specification defined standards for ×4, ×8 and ×16 memory devices with capacities of 2, 4, 8 and 16 Gbit.[1][47]

Article: DDR5 SDRAM

Double Data Rate 5 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory(DDR5 SDRAM) is a type ofsynchronous dynamic random-access memory. Compared to its predecessorDDR4 SDRAM, DDR5 was planned to reduce power consumption, while doublingbandwidth.[5]The standard, originally targeted for 2018,[6]was released on July 14, 2020.[2]

A new feature called Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) enables input/output (I/O) speed scalability for higher bandwidth and performance improvement. DDR5 has about the same14nslatencyas DDR4 and DDR3.[7]DDR5 octuples the maximum DIMM capacity from 64 GB to 512 GB.[8][3]DDR5 also has higher frequencies than DDR4, up to 9600 MT/s is currently possible, 8200 MT/s translates into around 120 GB/s of bandwidth. Speeds of more than 13,000 MT/s (13 GT/s) have been achieved using liquid nitrogen.[9]

Rambusannounced a working DDR5dual in-line memory module(DIMM) in September 2017.[10][11]On November 15, 2018,SK Hynixannounced completion of its first DDR5 RAM chip; running at 5.2GT/sat 1.1 V.[12]In February 2019, SK Hynix announced a 6.4 GT/s chip, the highest speed specified by the preliminary DDR5 standard.[13]The first production DDR5 DRAM chip was officially launched by SK Hynix on October 6, 2020.[14][15]

The separateJEDECstandardLow Power Double Data Rate 5(LPDDR5), intended for laptops and smartphones, was released in February 2019.[16]

Compared to DDR4, DDR5 further reduces memory voltage to1.1V, thus reducing power consumption. DDR5 modules incorporate on-board voltage regulators in order to reach higher speeds.[11][failed verification][17]

In 2024 the firstCUDIMM(clocked unbuffered DIMM) and CSODIMM (clocked SODIMM) modules were introduced together with Intel Arrow Lake. These modules include a component to re-drive the clock signal to help reach higher speeds.[18]AMD does not support CUDIMM, though Zen 5 will accept CUDIMMs in bypass mode.

Unlike DDR4, all DDR5 chips have on-dieerror-correction code, that detects and corrects errors before sending data to the CPU, to improve reliability and allow denser RAM chips with higher per-chip defect rate to be used.[19]

However, on-die error-correction code is not the same as trueECC memorywith extra chips for correction data on the memory module. Non-ECC and ECC DDR5 DIMM variants still exist; as with earlier RAM, ECC variants have extra data chips and data lines to the CPU for the additional error-detection data (8 more bits per 64 bits).

On-die ECC happens at a lower level than true ECC memory and does not report any details about whether errors are detected, unlike externally-controlled ECC. Sophisticated algorithms have been built to infer the existence of corrected errors based on non-corrected errors.[20]

Each DDR5DIMMhas two independent channels. Earlier DIMM generations featured only a single channel and one CA (Command/Address) bus controlling the whole memory module with its 64 (for non-ECC) or 72 (for ECC) data lines. Both subchannels on a DDR5 DIMM each have their own CA bus, controlling 32 bits for non-ECC memory and either 36 or 40 data lines for ECC memory, resulting in a total number of either 64, 72 or 80 data lines. The reduced bus width is compensated by a doubled minimum burst length of 16, which preserves the minimum access size of 64 bytes, which matches thecache linesize used by modernx86microprocessors.[21]

DDR5 also decreased the refresh interval from 64 ms to 32 ms when operating at and below 85°C. The tRFC4 mechanism from DDR4 is retired. A tRFCsb timing is added.

Multiple DDR5 memory chips can be mounted on a circuit board to form memory modules. For use in personal computers and servers, DDR5 memory is usually supplied in 288-pin dual in-line memory modules, more commonly known asDIMMs. As with previous memory generations, there are multiple DIMM variants available for DDR5.

Unbuffered memory modules (UDIMMs) directly expose the memory chip interface
to the module connector. Registered or load-reduced variants (RDIMMs/LRDIMMs) use 
additional active circuitry on the memory module in order to buffer the 
signals between the memory controller and the DRAM chips.
This reduces thecapacitiveload on the DDR5 bus.

DDR5 RDIMMs/LRDIMMs use 12Vand UDIMMs use 5 V input.[22]In order to prevent damage by accidental insertion of the wrong memory type, DDR5 UDIMMs and (L)RDIMMs are not mechanically compatible. Additionally, DDR5 DIMMs are supplied with management interface power at 3.3 V,[23][24]and use on-board circuitry (apower management integrated circuit[25]and associatedpassive components) to convert to the lower voltage required by the memory chips.  Final voltage regulation close to the point of use provides more stable power, and mirrors the development ofvoltage regulator modulesfor CPU power supplies.

Standard DDR5 memory speeds range from 4,000 to 6,400 milliontransfers per second(PC5-32000 to PC5-51200).[3]Higher speeds may be added later, as happened with previous generations. XMP profiles currently allow 8000 MT/s with 1.400 V/1.450 V, which is much higher than 1.1 V in the JEDEC standard.

Compared to DDR4 SDRAM, the minimum burst length was doubled to 16, with the option of "burst chop" after eight transfers. The addressing range is also slightly extended as follows:

The command encoding was significantly rearranged and takes inspiration from that ofLPDDR4; commands are sent using either one or two cycles with 14-bit bus.  Some simple commands (e.g. precharge) take one cycle, while any that include an address (activate, read, write) use two cycles to include 28 bits of information.

Also like LPDDR, there are now 256 8-bit mode registers, rather than eight 13-bit mode registers.  Also, rather than one register (MR7) being reserved for use by the registered clock driver chip, a complete second bank of mode registers is defined (selected using the CW bit).

Article: PCI Express

PCI Express(Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), officially abbreviated asPCIe,[2]is a high-speed standard used to connect hardware components inside computers. It is designed to replace olderexpansion busstandards such asPCI,PCI-XandAGP. Developed and maintained by thePCI-SIG(PCI Special Interest Group), PCIe is commonly used to connectgraphics cards,sound cards,Wi-FiandEthernetadapters, and storage devices such assolid-state drivesandhard disk drives.[3]

Compared to earlier standards, PCIe supports faster data transfer, uses fewer pins, takes up less space, and allows devices to be added or removed while the computer is running (hot swapping). It also includes better error detection and supports newer features likeI/O virtualizationfor advanced computing needs.[4]

PCIe connections are made throughlanes, which are pairs of conductors that send and receive data. Devices can use one or more lanes depending on how much data they need to transfer.[5]PCIe technology is also used in laptop expansion cards (likeExpressCard) and in storage connectors such asM.2,U.2, andSATA Express.

Conceptually, the PCI Express bus is a high-speedserialreplacement of the older PCI/PCI-X bus.[8]One of the key differences between the PCI Express bus and the older PCI is the bus topology; PCI uses a sharedparallelbusarchitecture, in which the PCI host and all devices share a common set of address, data, and control lines. In contrast, PCI Express is based on point-to-pointtopology, with separateseriallinks connecting every device to theroot complex(host). Because of its shared bus topology, access to the older PCI bus is arbitrated (in the case of multiple masters), and limited to one master at a time, in a single direction. Furthermore, the older PCI clocking scheme limits the bus clock to the slowest peripheral on the bus (regardless of the devices involved in the bus transaction). In contrast, a PCI Express bus link supportsfull-duplexcommunication between any two endpoints, with no inherent limitation on concurrent access across multiple endpoints.

In terms of bus protocol, PCI Express communication is encapsulated in packets. The work of packetizing and de-packetizing data and status-message traffic is handled by the transaction layer of the PCI Express port (described later). Radical differences in electrical signaling and bus protocol require the use of a different mechanical form factor and expansion connectors (and thus, new motherboards and new adapter boards); PCI slots and PCI Express slots are not interchangeable. At the software level, PCI Express preservesbackward compatibilitywith PCI; legacy PCI system software can detect and configure newer PCI Express devices without explicit support for the PCI Express standard, though new PCI Express features are inaccessible.

The PCI Express link between two devices can vary in size from one to 16lanes. In a multi-lane link, the packet data is striped across lanes, and peak data throughput scales with the overall link width. The lane count is automatically negotiated during device initialization and can be restricted by either endpoint. For example, a single-lane PCI Express (×1) card can be inserted into a multi-lane slot (×4, ×8, etc.), and the initialization cycle auto-negotiates the highest mutually supported lane count. The link can dynamically down-configure itself to use fewer lanes, providing a failure tolerance in case bad or unreliable lanes are present. The PCI Express standard defines link widths of ×1, ×2, ×4, ×8, and ×16. Up to and including PCIe 5.0, ×12, and ×32 links were defined as well but virtually[clarification needed]never used.[9]This allows the PCI Express bus to serve both cost-sensitive applications where high throughput is not needed, and performance-critical applications such as 3D graphics, networking (10 Gigabit Ethernetor multiportGigabit Ethernet), and enterprise storage (SASorFibre Channel). Slots and connectors are only defined for a subset of these widths, with link widths in between using the next larger physical slot size.

As a point of reference, a PCI-X (133 MHz 64-bit) device and a PCI Express 1.0 device using four lanes (×4) have roughly the same peak single-direction transfer rate of 1064 MB/s. The PCI Express bus has the potential to perform better than the PCI-X bus in cases where multiple devices are transferring data simultaneously, or if communication with the PCI Express peripheral isbidirectional.

PCI Express devices communicate via a logical connection called aninterconnect[10]orlink. A link is a point-to-point communication channel between two PCI Express ports allowing both of them to send and receive ordinary PCI requests (configuration, I/O or memory read/write) andinterrupts(INTx,MSI or MSI-X). At the physical level, a link is composed of one or morelanes.[10]Low-speed peripherals (such as an802.11Wi-Ficard) use a single-lane (×1) link, while a graphics adapter typically uses a much wider and therefore faster 16-lane (×16) link.

A lane is composed of twodifferential signalingpairs, with one pair for receiving data and the other for transmitting. Thus, each lane is composed of four wires orsignal traces. Conceptually, each lane is used as afull-duplexbyte stream, transporting data packets in eight-bit "byte" format simultaneously in both directions between endpoints of a link.[11]Physical PCI Express links may contain 1, 4, 8 or 16 lanes.[12][6]: 4, 5[10]Lane counts are written with an "x" prefix (for example, "×8" represents an eight-lane card or slot), with ×16 being the largest size in common use.[13]Lane sizes are also referred to via the terms "width" or "by" e.g., an eight-lane slot could be referred to as a "by 8" or as "8 lanes wide."

The bonded serialbusarchitecture was chosen over the traditional parallel bus because of the inherent limitations of the latter, includinghalf-duplexoperation, excess signal count, and inherently lowerbandwidthdue totiming skew. Timing skew results from separate electrical signals within a parallel interface traveling through conductors of different lengths, on potentially differentprinted circuit board(PCB) layers, and at possibly differentsignal velocities. Despite being transmitted simultaneously as a singleword, signals on a parallel interface have different travel duration and arrive at their destinations at different times. When the interface clock period is shorter than the largest time difference between signal arrivals, recovery of the transmitted word is no longer possible. Since timing skew over a parallel bus can amount to a few nanoseconds, the resulting bandwidth limitation is in the range of hundreds of megahertz.

A serial interface does not exhibit timing skew because there is only one differential signal in each direction within each lane, and there is no external clock signal since clocking information isembeddedwithin the serial signal itself. As such, typical bandwidth limitations on serial signals are in the multi-gigahertz range. PCI Express is one example of the general trend toward replacing parallel buses with serial interconnects; other examples includeSerial ATA(SATA),USB,Serial Attached SCSI(SAS),FireWire(IEEE 1394), andRapidIO. In digital video, examples in common use areDVI,HDMI, andDisplayPort, but they were replacements for analog VGA, not for a parallel bus.

Multichannel serial design increases flexibility with its ability to allocate fewer lanes for slower devices.

A PCI Express add-in card fits into a slot of its physical size or larger (with ×16 as the largest used), but may not fit into a smaller PCI Express slot; for example, a ×16 card may not fit into a ×4 or ×8 slot. Some slots use open-ended sockets to permit physically longer cards and negotiate the best available electrical and logical connection.

The number of lanes actually connected to a slot may also be fewer than the number supported by the physical slot size. An example is a ×16 slot that runs at ×4, which accepts any ×1, ×2, ×4, ×8 or ×16 card, but provides only four lanes. Its specification may read as "×16 (×4 mode)" or "×16 (×4 signal)", while "mechanical @ electrical" notation (e.g. "×16 @ ×4") is also common.[citation needed]The advantage is that such slots can accommodate a larger range of PCI Express cards without requiring motherboard hardware to support the full transfer rate. Standard mechanical sizes are ×1, ×4, ×8, and ×16. Cards using a number of lanes other than the standard mechanical sizes need to physically fit the next larger mechanical size (e.g. an ×2 card uses the ×4 size, or an ×12 card uses the ×16 size).

The cards themselves are designed and manufactured in various sizes. For example,solid-state drives(SSDs) that come in the form of PCI Express cards often useHHHL(half height, half length) andFHHL(full height, half length) to describe the physical dimensions of the card. The concept of "full" and "half" heights and lengths are inherited from Conventional PCI.[15][16]

The length levels beside full are not a PCIe standard, but only a manufacturer agreement. Half length provides sufficient space for a ×16 connector. Below that narrower data connectors need to be used.

There is a fixed distance of 57.15 millimetres (2.250 in) between the connector's key notch (middle ridge diving data and power) and the end of the card, which may be covered by an end plate with a screw-hole for installing onto the computer case. This fixed length ensures that cards do not protrude out of the chassis.

Article: NVMe

NVM Express(NVMe) orNon-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification(NVMHCIS) is anopen,logical-deviceinterfacespecificationfor accessing a computer'snon-volatile storagemedia usually attached via thePCI Expressbus. The initialNVMstands fornon-volatile memory, which is often NANDflash memorythat comes in several physical form factors, includingsolid-state drives(SSDs), PCIe add-in cards, andM.2cards, the successor tomSATAcards. NVM Express, as a logical-device interface, has been designed to capitalize on the lowlatencyand internal parallelism of solid-state storage devices.[1]

Architecturally, the logic for NVMe is physically stored within and executed by the NVMe controller chip that is physically co-located with the storage media, usually an SSD. Version changes for NVMe, e.g., 1.3 to 1.4, are incorporated within the storage media, and do not affect PCIe-compatible components such as motherboards and CPUs.[2]

By its design, NVM Express allows host hardware and software to fully exploit the levels ofparallelismpossible in modern SSDs. As a result, NVM Express reducesI/Ooverhead and brings various performance improvements relative to previous logical-device interfaces, including multiple long command queues, and reduced latency. The previous interface protocols likeAHCIwere developed for use with far slowerhard disk drives(HDD) where a very lengthy delay (relative to CPU operations) exists between a request and data transfer, where data speeds are much slower than RAM speeds, and where disk rotation andseek timegive rise to further optimization requirements.

NVM Express devices are chiefly available in the miniatureM.2form factor, while standard-sized PCI Expressexpansion cards[3]and 2.5-inch form-factor devices that provide a four-lane PCI Express interface through theU.2connector (formerly known as SFF-8639) are also available.[4][5]

Historically, most SSDs usedbusessuch asSATA,[19]SAS,[20][21]orFibre Channelfor interfacing with the rest of a computer system. Since SSDs became available in mass markets, SATA has become the most typical way for connecting SSDs inpersonal computers; however, SATA was designed primarily for interfacing with mechanicalhard disk drives(HDDs), and it became increasingly inadequate for SSDs, which improved in speed over time.[22]For example, within about five years of mass market mainstream adoption (2005–2010) many SSDs were already held back by the comparatively slow data rates available for hard drives—unlike hard disk drives, some SSDs are limited by the maximumthroughputof SATA.

High-end SSDs had been made using thePCI Expressbus before NVMe, but using non-standard specification interfaces, using a SAS to PCIe bridge[23]or by emulating a hardware RAID controller.[24]By standardizing the interface of SSDs,operating systemsonly need one commondevice driverto work with all SSDs adhering to the specification. It also means that each SSD manufacturer does not have to design specific interface drivers. This is similar to howUSB mass storagedevices are built to follow theUSBmass-storage device class specification and work with all computers, with no per-device drivers needed.[25]

NVM Express devices are also used as the building block of theburst bufferstorage in many leading supercomputers, such asFugaku Supercomputer,Summit SupercomputerandSierra Supercomputer, etc.[26][27]

The first details of a new standard for accessing non-volatile memory emerged at theIntel Developer Forum2007, when NVMHCI was shown as the host-side protocol of a proposed architectural design that hadOpen NAND Flash Interface Working Group(ONFI) on the memory (flash) chips side.[28]A NVMHCI working group led by Intel was formed that year. The NVMHCI 1.0 specification was completed in April 2008 and released on Intel's web site.[29][30][31]

Technical work on NVMe began in the second half of 2009.[32]The NVMe specifications were developed by the NVM Express Workgroup, which consists of more than 90 companies; Amber Huffman ofIntelwas the working group's chair. Version 1.0 of the specification was released on 1 March 2011,[33]while version 1.1 of the specification was released on 11 October 2012.[34]Major features added in version 1.1 are multi-path I/O (with namespace sharing) and arbitrary-lengthscatter-gatherI/O. It is expected that future revisions will significantly enhance namespace management.[32]Because of its feature focus, NVMe 1.1 was initially called "Enterprise NVMHCI".[35]An update for the base NVMe specification, called version 1.0e, was released in January 2013.[36]In June 2011, a Promoter Group led by seven companies was formed.

The first commercially available NVMe chipsets were released byIntegrated Device Technology(89HF16P04AG3 and 89HF32P08AG3) in August 2012.[37][38]The first NVMe drive,Samsung's XS1715enterprise drive, was announced in July 2013; according to Samsung, this drive supported 3 GB/s read speeds, six times faster than their previous enterprise offerings.[39]The LSISandForceSF3700 controller family, released in November 2013, also supports NVMe.[40][41]A KingstonHyperX"prosumer" product using this controller was showcased at theConsumer Electronics Show2014 and promised similar performance.[42][43]In June 2014, Intel announced their first NVM Express products, the Intel SSD data center family that interfaces with the host through PCI Express bus, which includes the DC P3700 series, the DC P3600 series, and the DC P3500 series.[44]As of November 2014[update], NVMe drives are commercially available.

In March 2014, the group incorporated to become NVM Express, Inc., which as of November 2014[update]consists of more than 65 companies from across the industry. NVM Express specifications are owned and maintained by NVM Express, Inc., which also promotes industry awareness of NVM Express as an industry-wide standard. NVM Express, Inc. is directed by a thirteen-member board of directors selected from the Promoter Group, which includes Cisco, Dell, EMC, HGST, Intel, Micron, Microsoft, NetApp, Oracle, PMC, Samsung, SanDisk and Seagate.[45]

In September 2016, the CompactFlash Association announced that it would be releasing a new memory card specification,CFexpress, which uses NVMe.[citation needed]

NVMeHost Memory Buffer(HMB) feature added in version 1.2 of the NVMe specification.[46]HMB allows SSDs to use the host'sDRAM, which can improve the I/O performance for DRAM-less SSDs.[47]For example, HMB can be used for cache theFTLtable by the SSD controller, which can improve I/O performance.[48]NVMe 2.0 added optionalZoned Namespaces(ZNS) feature andKey-Value(KV) feature, and support for rotating media such ashard disk drives. ZNS and KV allows data to be mapped directly to its physical location in flash memory to directly access data on an SSD.[49]ZNS and KV can also decreasewrite amplificationof flash media.

Almost all early NVMe solid-state drives are HHHL (half height, half length) or FHHL (full height, half length)PCI Expresscards, with a PCIe 2.0 or 3.0 interface. A HHHL NVMe solid-state drive card is easy to insert into a PCIe slot of a server.

SATA Expressallows the use of two PCI Express 2.0 or 3.0 lanes and two SATA 3.0 (6 Gbit/s) ports through the same host-side SATA Express connector (but not both at the same time). SATA Express supports NVMe as the logical device interface for attached PCI Express storage devices. It is electrically compatible withMultiLink SAS, so a backplane can support both at the same time.

U.2, formerly known asSFF-8639, uses the same physical port as SATA Express but allows up to four PCI Express lanes. Available servers can combine up to 48 U.2 NVMe solid-state drives.[50]

U.3 (SFF-TA-1001) is built on the U.2 spec and uses the same SFF-8639 connector. Unlike in U.2, a single "tri-mode" (PCIe/SATA/SAS) backplane receptacle can handle all three types of connections; the controller automatically detects the type of connection used. This is unlike U.2, where users need to use separate controllers for SATA/SAS and NVMe. U.3 devices are required to be backwards-compatible with U.2 hosts, but U.2 drives are not compatible with U.3 hosts.[51][52]

M.2, formerly known as theNext Generation Form Factor(NGFF), uses a M.2 NVMe solid-state drivecomputer bus. Interfaces provided through the M.2 connector arePCI Express 3.0or higher (up to fourlanes). The connector is small compared to typical AICs. Most SSDs are 22 mm wide and can range from 6, 26, 30, 38, 42, 60, 80 and 110 mm.[53]

Article: SATA

SATA(Serial AT Attachment)[a][2]is acomputer businterface that connectshost bus adapterstomass storage devicessuch ashard disk drives,optical drives, andsolid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the earlierParallel ATA(PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.

Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from theSerial ATA International Organization(SATA-IO) which are then released by theINCITSTechnical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).[3]

SATA was announced in 2000[4][5]in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), nativehot swapping, fasterdata transferthrough higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional)I/Oqueuing protocol.Revision 1.0of the specification was released in January 2003.[2]

Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from theSerial ATA International Organization(SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases andplugfests. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13[3]and an INCITST10 subcommittee(SCSI), a subgroup of T10 responsible forSerial Attached SCSI(SAS). The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications.

Before SATA's introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA. The "AT Attachment" (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of theIBM Personal Computer AT, more commonly known as the IBM AT.[6]The IBM AT's controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks. "AT" was IBM's abbreviation for "Advanced Technology"; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of "Serial Advanced Technology Attachment". However, the ATA specifications simply use the name "AT Attachment", to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM.[7]

SATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speedserialcable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (theredesignationfor the legacy ATA specifications) uses a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at a much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA andATAPIcommand sets as legacy ATA devices.

The world's first SATA hard disk drive is the Seagate Barracuda SATA V, which was released in January 2003.[8]

SATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptopcomputers; SATA's market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008.[9]PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that useCompactFlash(CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard. A 2008 standard,CFast, to replace CompactFlash is based on SATA.[10][11]

The Serial ATA spec requires SATA devices be capable ofhot plugging; that is, devices that meet the specification are capable of insertion or removal of a device into or from a backplane connector (combined signal and power) that has power on. After insertion, the device initializes and then operates normally. Depending upon the operating system, the host may also initialize, resulting in ahot swap. The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal, although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed.

Unlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design. However, this feature requires proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, SATA devices fulfill the device-side hot-plugging requirements, and most SATAhost adapterssupport this function.[1]

Advanced Host Controller Interface(AHCI) is an open host controller interface published and used byIntel, which has become ade factostandard. It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such ashotplugandnative command queuing(NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in "IDE[b]emulation" mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.

Windows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode, inRAIDmode, or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA's advanced features before AHCI became popular. Modern versions ofMicrosoft Windows,Mac OS X,FreeBSD,Linuxwith version 2.6.19 onward,[13]as well asSolarisandOpenSolaris, include support for AHCI, but earlier operating systems such asWindows XPdo not. Even in those instances, a proprietary driver may have been created for a specific chipset, such as Intel's.[14]

SATA revisions are typically designated with a dash followed byRoman numerals, e.g. "SATA-III",[15]to avoid confusion with the speed, which is always displayed inArabic numerals, e.g. "SATA 6Gbit/s". The speeds given are theraw interface ratein Gbit/s includingline codeoverhead, and theusable data rateinMB/s without overhead.

Revision 1.0a[2]was released on January 7, 2003. First-generation SATA interfaces, now known as SATA 1.5 Gbit/s, communicate at a rate of 1.5 Gbit/s, and do not supportNative Command Queuing(NCQ). Taking8b/10b encodingoverhead into account, they have an actualuncoded transfer rateof 1.2 Gbit/s (150 MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s is similar to that ofPATA/133, but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ, which improve performance in a multitasking environment.

During the initial period after SATA 1.5 Gbit/s finalization, adapter and drive manufacturers used a "bridge chip" to convert existing PATA designs for use with the SATA interface. Bridged drives have a SATA connector, may include either or both kinds of power connectors, and, in general, perform identically to their native-SATA equivalents.[16]

As of April 2010[update], the fastest 10,000 rpm SATAhard disk drivescould transfer data at maximum (not average) rates of up to 157 MB/s,[17]which is beyond the capabilities of the older PATA/133 specification and also exceeds the capabilities of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s.

SATA revision 2.0 was released in April 2004, introducing Native Command Queuing (NCQ). It isbackward compatiblewith SATA 1.5 Gbit/s.[18]

Second-generation SATA interfaces run with a native transfer rate of 3.0 Gbit/s that, when accounted for the8b/10b encodingscheme, equals to the maximum uncoded transfer rate of 2.4 Gbit/s (300 MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of the SATA revision 2.0, which is also known as the SATA 3 Gbit/s, doubles the throughput of SATA revision 1.0.

Article: USB

Universal Serial Bus(USB) is anindustry standard, developed byUSB Implementers Forum(USB-IF), for digital data transmission and power delivery between many types of electronics. It specifies the architecture, in particular the physicalinterfaces, andcommunication protocolsto and fromhosts, such aspersonal computers, to and fromperipheraldevices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediatehubs, which multiply the number of a host's ports.[2]

Introduced in 1996, USB was originally designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to computers, replacing various interfaces such asserial ports,parallel ports,game ports, andApple Desktop Bus(ADB) ports.[3]Early versions of USB became commonplace on a wide range of devices, such as keyboards, mice, cameras, printers, scanners, flash drives, smartphones, game consoles, and power banks.[4]USB has since evolved into a standard to replace virtually all common ports on computers, mobile devices, peripherals, power supplies, and manifold other small electronics.

In the latest standard, theUSB-Cconnector replaces many types of connectors for power (up to 240 W), displays (e.g. DisplayPort, HDMI), and many other uses, as well as all previous USB connectors.

As of 2024,[update]USB consists of four generations of specifications:USB 1.x,USB 2.0,USB 3.x, andUSB4. The USB4 specification enhances the data transfer and power delivery functionality with "a connection-oriented tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface so that the total speed and performance of the USB4 Fabric can be dynamically shared."[2]In particular, USB4 supports the tunneling of theThunderbolt 3protocols, namelyPCI Express(PCIe, load/store interface) andDisplayPort(display interface). USB4 also adds host-to-host interfaces.[2]

Each specification sub-version supports differentsignaling ratesfrom 1.5 and 12 Mbit/shalf-duplexin USB 1.0/1.1 to 80 Gbit/sfull-duplexin USB4 2.0.[5][6][7][2]USB also provides power to peripheral devices; the latest versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 240 watts as defined inUSB Power Delivery (USB-PD)Rev. V3.1.[8]Over the years, USB(-PD) has been adopted as the standard power supply and charging format for many mobile devices, such as mobile phones, reducing the need for proprietary chargers.[9]

USB was designed to standardize the connection ofperipheralsto personal computers, both to exchange data and to supply electric power. It has largely replaced interfaces such asserial portsandparallel portsand has become commonplace on various devices. Peripherals connected via USB include computer keyboards and mice, video cameras, printers, portable media players, mobile (portable) digital telephones, disk drives, and network adapters.

USB connectors have been increasingly replacing other types of charging cables for portable devices.[10][11][12]

USB connector interfaces are classified into three types: the many variouslegacyType-A (upstream) and Type-B (downstream) connectors found onhosts,hubs, andperipheral devices, and the modern Type-C (USB-C) connector, which replaces the many legacy connectors as the only applicable connector for USB4.

The Type-A and Type-B connectors came in Standard, Mini, and Micro sizes. The standard format was the largest and was mainly used for desktop and larger peripheral equipment. The Mini-USB connectors (Mini-A, Mini-B, Mini-AB) were introduced for mobile devices. Still, they were quickly replaced by the thinner Micro-USB connectors (Micro-A, Micro-B, Micro-AB). The Type-C connector, also known as USB-C, is not exclusive to USB, is the only current standard for USB, is required for USB4, and is required by other standards, including modern DisplayPort and Thunderbolt. It is reversible and can support various functionalities and protocols, including USB; some are mandatory, and many are optional, depending on the type of hardware: host, peripheral device, or hub.[13][14]

USB specifications provide backward compatibility, usually resulting in decreased signaling rates, maximal power offered, and other capabilities. The USB 1.1 specification replaces USB 1.0. The USB 2.0 specification is backward-compatible with USB 1.0/1.1. The USB 3.2 specification replaces USB 3.1 (and USB 3.0) while including the USB 2.0 specification. USB4 "functionally replaces" USB 3.2 while retaining the USB 2.0 bus operating in parallel.[5][6][7][2]

The USB 3.0 specification defined a new architecture and protocol namedSuperSpeed(akaSuperSpeed USB, marketed asSS), which included a new lane for a new signal coding scheme (8b/10b symbols, 5 Gbit/s; later also known asGen 1) providing full-duplex data transfers that physically required five additional wires and pins, while preserving the USB 2.0 architecture and protocols and therefore keeping the original four pins/wires for the USB 2.0 backward-compatibility resulting in 9 wires (with 9 or 10 pins at connector interfaces; ID-pin is not wired) in total.

The USB 3.1 specification introduced anEnhanced SuperSpeed System– while preserving theSuperSpeedarchitecture and protocol (SuperSpeed USB) – with an additionalSuperSpeedPlusarchitecture and protocol (akaSuperSpeedPlus USB) adding a new coding schema (128b/132b symbols, 10 Gbit/s; also known asGen 2); for some time marketed asSuperSpeed+(SS+).

The USB 3.2 specification[15]added a second lane to theEnhanced SuperSpeed Systembesides other enhancements so that theSuperSpeedPlus USBsystem part implements theGen 1×2,Gen 2×1,andGen 2×2operation modes. However, theSuperSpeed USBpart of the system still implements the one-laneGen 1×1operation mode. Therefore, two-lane operations, namelyUSB 3.2 Gen 1×2(10 Gbit/s) andGen 2×2(20 Gbit/s), are only possible with Full-Featured USB-C. As of 2023, they are somewhat rarely implemented; Intel, however, started to include them in its 11th-generation SoC processor models, but Apple never provided them. On the other hand,USB 3.2 Gen 1(×1)(5 Gbit/s) andGen 2(×1)(10 Gbit/s) have been quite common for some years.

Each USB connection is made using two connectors: areceptacleand aplug. Pictures show only receptacles:

The Universal Serial Bus was developed to simplify and improve the interface between personal computers and peripheral devices, such as cell phones, computer accessories, and monitors, when compared with previously existing standard orad hocproprietary interfaces.[17]

The USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:

For a product developer, using USB requires the implementation of a complex protocol and implies an "intelligent" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID, which requires that they pay a fee to theUSB Implementers Forum(USB-IF). Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the USB-IF. Use of the USB logos on the product requires annual fees and membership in the organization.[17]

Article: Thunderbolt (interface)

Thunderboltis the brand name of ahardware interfacefor the connection of externalperipheralsto acomputer. It was developed byIntelin collaboration withApple.[7][8]It was initially marketed under the nameLight Peak, and first sold as part of anend-userproduct on 24 February 2011.[1]

Thunderbolt combinesPCI Express(PCIe) andDisplayPort(DP) into twoserialsignals[9][10]and providesDC powervia a single cable. Up to six peripherals may be supported by a single connector through varioustopologies. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the sameconnectorasMini DisplayPort(MDP), whereas Thunderbolt 3, 4, and 5 use theUSB-Cconnector and support USB devices.

Thunderbolt controllersmultiplexone or more individual data lanes from connected PCIe and DisplayPort devices for transmission via two duplex Thunderbolt lanes, then de-multiplex them for use by PCIe and DisplayPort devices on the other end.[2]A single Thunderbolt port supports up to six Thunderbolt devices via hubs ordaisy chains; as many of these as the host has DP sources may be Thunderboltmonitors.[11]A device with fewer than four PCIe lanes still qualifies as a Thunderbolt device, but will not support the full capabilities and speeds of Thunderbolt.

A single Mini DisplayPort monitor or other device of any kind may be connected directly or at the very end of the chain. Thunderbolt is interoperable with DP-1.1a compatible devices. When connected to a DP-compatible device, the Thunderbolt port can provide a native DisplayPort signal with four lanes of output data at no more than 5.4 Gbit/s per Thunderbolt lane. When connected to a Thunderbolt device, the per-lane data rate achieves 10 Gbit/s and the four Thunderbolt lanes are configured as two duplex lanes, each 10 Gbit/s, comprising one lane of input and one lane of output.[2]

Thunderbolt can be implemented on PCIegraphics cards, which have access to DisplayPort data and PCIe connectivity, or on themotherboardof computers withonboard video, such as theMacBook Air.[11][12][13]

The interface was originally intended to run exclusively on an optical physical layer using components and flexibleoptical fibercabling developed by Intel partners and at Intel's Silicon Photonics lab. It was initially marketed under the name Light Peak[14]and, after 2011, as Silicon Photonics Link.[15]However, it was eventually discovered that conventionalcopperwiring could furnish the desired 10 Gbit/s per channel at lower cost.

This copper-based version of the Light Peak concept was co-developed byAppleandIntel. Apple registeredThunderboltas atrademark, but later transferred the mark to Intel, which held overridingintellectual propertyrights.[16]Thunderbolt was commercially introduced on Apple's 2011MacBook Pro, using the same Apple-developed connector asMini DisplayPort.

In January 2013,Sumitomo Electric Industriesbegan selling optical Thunderbolt cables of up to 30 m (100 ft) in length in Japan,[17]while in late September 2013,Corning Inc.started sellingfiber-optic cablesof up to 60 m (200 ft) in length in the United States.[18]

Intelintroduced Light Peak at the 2009Intel Developer Forum(IDF), using a prototypeMac Prologic board to run two1080pvideo streams plusLANand storage devices over a single 30-meter optical cable with modifiedUSBends.[19]The system was driven by a prototypePCI Expresscard, with two optical buses powering four ports.[20]Jason Ziller, head of Intel's Optical I/O Program Office, presented the internal components of the technology under a microscope and the delivery of data through anoscilloscope.[21]The technology was described as having an initial speed of 10 Gbit/s over plastic optical cables, alongside promising a final speed of 100 Gbit/s.[22]At the show, Intel announced Light Peak-equipped systems would begin to appear in 2010, and posted aYouTubevideo showing Light Peak-connected HD cameras, laptops, docking stations, and HD monitors.[23]

On 4 May 2010, inBrussels, Intel demonstrated a laptop with a Light Peak connector, indicating that the technology had shrunk enough to fit inside such a device, and had the laptop send two simultaneous HD video streams down the connection, indicating that at least some fraction of the software/firmware stacks and protocols were functional. At the same demonstration, Intel officials stated they expected hardware manufacturing to begin around the end of 2010.[24]

In September 2010, some early commercial prototypes from manufacturers were demonstrated at theIntel Developer Forum2010.[25]

CNET's Brooke Crothers said it was rumored that the early-2011 MacBook Pro update would include some sort of new data port, and he speculated it would be Light Peak (Thunderbolt).[26]At the time, there were no details on the physical implementation, and mock-ups appeared showing a system similar to the earlier Intel demos that utilizes a combined USB/Light Peak port.[27]Shortly before the release of the new machines, theUSB Implementers Forum(USB-IF) announced it would not allow such a combination port, and that USB was not open to modification in that way.

Other implementations of the technology began in 2012, with desktop boards offering the interconnection now available.[28]

Apple stated in February 2011 that the port was based onMini DisplayPort, not USB. As the system was described, Intel's solution to the display connection problem became clear: Thunderbolt controllers multiplex data from existing DP systems with data from the PCIe port into a single cable. Older displays using DP 1.1a or earlier must be located at the end of a Thunderbolt device chain, but native displays can be anywhere along the line.[12]Thunderbolt devices can go anywhere on the chain. In that respect, Thunderbolt shares a relationship with the olderACCESS.bussystem, which used the display connector to support a low-speed bus.

Apple states that up to six daisy-chained peripherals are supported per Thunderbolt port[29]and that the display should be attached at the end of the chain if it does not support daisy-chaining.

In February 2011,AppleintroducedMacBook Pro(13-inch, Early 2011),[30]MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011),[31]and MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011)[32]featuring one Thunderbolt port. In May 2011, Apple introduced theiMac(21.5-inch, Mid 2011),[33]featuring one Thunderbolt port, and the iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011),[34]featuring two Thunderbolt ports. In July 2011, Apple introducedMac Mini(Mid 2011),[35]MacBook Air(11-inch, Mid 2011),[36]MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2011),[37]andApple Thunderbolt Display,[38]featuring one Thunderbolt port for daisy-chaining or other devices.

The Thunderbolt port on the new Macs is in the same location relative to other ports and maintains the same physical dimensions and pinout as the prior MDP connector. The main visible difference on Thunderbolt-equippedMacsis a Thunderbolt symbol next to the port.[11]

The DisplayPort standard is partially compatible with Thunderbolt, as the two share Apple's physically compatible MDP connector. The Target Display mode on iMacs requires a Thunderbolt cable to accept a video-in signal from another Thunderbolt-capable computer.[40]A DP monitor must be the last (or only) device in a chain of Thunderbolt devices.

Nvidia Corporation[a](/ɛnˈvɪdiə/en-VID-ee-ə) is an American technology company headquartered inSanta Clara, California. Founded in 1993 byJensen Huang(who remainspresidentandCEO),Chris Malachowsky, andCurtis Priem, it developsgraphics processing units(GPUs),systems on chips(SoCs), andapplication programming interfaces(APIs) fordata science,high-performance computing, and mobile and automotive applications.[5][6]Nvidia has been occasionally described as aBig Techcompany.

Originally focused on GPUs for video gaming, Nvidia broadened their use into other markets, includingartificial intelligence(AI), professional visualization, andsupercomputing. The company's product lines includeGeForceGPUs for gaming and creative workloads, and professional GPUs foredge computing, scientific research, and industrial applications. As of the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia held a 92% share of the discrete desktop and laptop GPU market.[7][8]

In the early 2000s, the company invested over a billion dollars to developCUDA, a software platform and API that enabled GPUs to run massivelyparallel programsfor a broad range of compute-intensive applications.[9][10][11]As a result, as of 2025, Nvidia controlled more than 80% of the market for GPUs used in training and deploying AI models,[9]and provided chips for over 75% of the world'sTOP500supercomputers.[1]The company has also expanded into gaming hardware and services, with products such as theShield Portable,Shield Tablet, andShield TV, and operates theGeForce Nowcloud gaming service.[12]Furthermore, it has developed theTegraline of mobile processors for smartphones, tablets, and automotive infotainment systems.[13][14][15]

In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh U.S. company to reach aUS$1 trillion valuation.[16]It became the first company in the world to surpass US$4 trillion[17][18]and US$5 trillion[19]milestones inmarket capitalizationin 2025, driven by rising global demand for data center hardware in the midst of theAI boom. For its strength, size and market capitalization, Nvidia has been selected to be one ofBloomberg's "Magnificent Seven", the seven biggest companies on the stock market in these regards.[20]

Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,[21][22][23]byJensen Huang, aTaiwanese-Americanelectrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare atLSI Logicand amicroprocessordesigner atAMD;Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked atSun Microsystems; andCurtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer atIBMand Sun Microsystems.[24][25]In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at aDenny'sroadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.[26][27][28][29]

At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on "firmer ground",[30]in that he was already running his own division at LSI.[27]The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI[30]and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.[27]

The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods.[30]As Huang later explained: "We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don't happen very often. Video games was ourkiller app— a flywheel to reach large markets funding hugeR&Dto solve massive computational problems."[30]

The first problem was who would quit first. Huang's wife,Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and Malachowsky's wife, Melody, felt the same way about Huang.[31]Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun, effective December 31, 1992.[31]According to Priem, this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to "flail alone", so they gave notice too.[32]Huang left LSI and "officially joined Priem on February 17", which was also Huang's 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in early March.[32]In early 1993, the three founders began working together on their new startup in Priem's townhouse inFremont, California.[33]

With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[30]The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding fromSequoia Capital,Sutter Hill Ventures, and others.[34]

During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future.[26]Only two survived: Nvidia andATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD.[26]

Nvidia initially had no name.[35]Priem's first idea was "Primal Graphics", asyllabic abbreviationof two of the founders' last names, but that left out Huang.[35]They soon discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with syllables from all three founders' names, after considering "Huaprimal", "Prihuamal", "Malluapri", etc.[35]The next idea came from Priem's idea for the name of Nvidia's first product.[35]Priem originally wanted to call it the "GXNV", as in the "next version" of the GX graphics chips which he had worked on at Sun.[33]Then Huang told Priem to "drop the GX", resulting in the name "NV".[33]Priem made a list of words with the letters "NV" in them.[35]At one point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper.[27]Both Priem[35]and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the name Nvidia,[27]from "invidia", the Latin word for "envy".[30]

After the company outgrew Priem's townhouse, its original headquarters office was inSunnyvale, California.[30]

Nvidia's first graphics accelerator, theNV1, was designed to processquadrilateralprimitives(forward texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[27]However, whenMicrosoftintroduced theDirectXplatform, it chose not to support any other graphics software and announced that itsDirect3DAPI would exclusively support triangles.[27][36]As a result, the NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[37]

Nvidia had also entered into a partnership withSegato supply the graphics chip for theDreamcastconsole and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia's technology was already lagging behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[38]

In a pivotal moment, Sega's president,Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia's potential and persuaded Sega's management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri's "understanding and generosity gave us six months to live".[38]

In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: theRIVA 128.[27][36]By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month's payroll.[27]The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia's unofficial company motto: "Our company is thirty days from going out of business."[27]Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years.[27]

Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[27]and used the revenue to fund development of its next generation of products.[36]In 1998, the release of theRIVA TNThelped solidify Nvidia's reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[39]

Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[40][41][42]Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri's best decision as Sega's president. After Irimajiri left Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[38]

In late 1999, Nvidia released theGeForce 256(NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboardtransformation and lighting(T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration,motion compensation, and hardware sub-picturealpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(AMD) is an American multinational technology company headquartered inSanta Clara, California, with significant operations inAustin, Texas. It developscentral processing units(CPUs),graphics processing units(GPUs),field-programmable gate arrays(FPGAs),system-on-chips(SoCs), andhigh-performance computercomponents. AMD serves a wide range of business and consumer markets, including gaming, data centers,artificial intelligence(AI), and embedded systems.

AMD's main products includemicroprocessors,motherboardchipsets,embedded processors, andgraphics processorsforservers,workstations, personal computers, andembedded systemapplications. The company has also expanded into new markets, such as thedata center, gaming, andhigh-performance computing[2]markets. AMD's processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and gaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company lateroutsourced its manufacturing, afterGlobalFoundrieswas spun off in 2009. Through itsXilinxacquisition in 2022, AMD offersfield-programmable gate array(FPGA) products.

AMD was founded in 1969 byJerry Sandersand a group of other technology professionals. The company's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. In 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market, competing withIntel, its primary rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, it experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of itsAthlonandOpteronprocessors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.

In the late 2010s, AMD regained market share by pursuing apenetration pricingstrategy[3]and building on the success of itsRyzenprocessors, which were considerably more competitive with Intel microprocessors in terms of performance whilst offering attractive pricing.[4]In 2022, AMD surpassed Intel by market capitalization for the first time.[5][6]

Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated byJerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues fromFairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969.[7][8]Sanders, anelectrical engineerwho was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his ownsemiconductorcompany,[9]following the footsteps ofRobert Noyce(developer of the first siliconintegrated circuitat Fairchild in 1959)[10]andGordon Moore, who together founded the semiconductor companyIntelin July 1968.[11]

In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location inSanta Clarato its new $500,000 15,000sqft headquarters at 901 Thompson Place,Sunnyvale, which housed the entire company, including the 8-mask, 7 µm feature size, 2-inch diameter wafer production.[12][13]To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became asecond sourcesupplier of microchips designed by Fairchild (the 5VTTL"9300" logic series) andNational Semiconductor.[14][15]AMD first focused on producing logic chips.[16]The company guaranteed quality control toUnited States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – includingcomputer manufacturers, thetelecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid.[14][17][18][19]

In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product: the Am9300, a4-bitMSIshift register, which began selling in 1970.[19][21]Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful.[12][22]Its bestselling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastestmultiplieravailable.[12][23]

In 1971, AMD entered theRAMchip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM.[23][24]That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year-end the company's total annual sales reached US$4.6 million.[12][25]

AMD went public in September 1972.[14][26][27]The company was a second source for IntelMOS/LSIcircuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers.[28][29]By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (astaticN-channel1024-bit RAM)[30]and three low-powerSchottkyMSIcircuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.[31]

Intel had created the firstmicroprocessor, its 4-bit4004, in 1971.[32][33]By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with theAm9080, areverse-engineeredclone of theIntel 8080,[34][35][36]and theAm2900bit-slicemicroprocessor family.[35]When Intel began installingmicrocodein its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into across-licensingagreement with AMD, which was granted a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.[31][37][38][39][40]

In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture withSiemens, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market.[41]Siemens purchased 20% of AMD's stock, giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines.[41][42][43]The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers (AMC), located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, allowing AMD to enter themicrocomputerdevelopment and manufacturing field,[41][44][45][46]in particular based on AMD's second-sourceZilogZ8000microprocessors.[47][48]When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the American division in 1979.[49][50]AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.[47][51][52]

Total sales infiscal year1978 topped $100 million,[44]and in 1979, AMD debuted on theNew York Stock Exchange.[22]In 1979, production also began on AMD's newsemiconductor fabrication plantinAustin, Texas;[22]the company already had overseas assembly facilities inPenangandManila,[53]and began construction on a fabrication plant inSan Antonioin 1981.[54]In 1980, AMD began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications, an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation.[55]

Intelhad introduced the firstx86microprocessors in 1978.[56]In 1981,IBMcreated itsPC, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel would also provide asecond-sourcemanufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors.[17]Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981[51][57]and formally executed in February 1982.[40]The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could "earn" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company.[39]The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD–Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995.[39][40]The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.[39]The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its8086,80186, and80286chips.[40]However, in the event of a bankruptcy or takeover of AMD, the cross-licensing agreement would be effectively canceled.[58]

Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984, its ownAm286clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs andIBM clones.[17][59]It also continued its successful concentration on proprietarybipolarchips.[60]

The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,[61]and created the world's first 512KEPROMin 1984.[62]That year, AMD was listed in the bookThe 100 Best Companies to Work for in America,[54][63]and later made theFortune500list for the first time in 1985.[64][65]

By mid-1985, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the United States.[66]AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,[67]devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chipset per week for 52 weeks infiscal year1986,[54][68]and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.[69]During this time, AMD withdrew from theDRAMmarket,[70]and made some headway into theCMOSmarket, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.[71]

AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 "World Chip"FSKmodem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell andCCITTtones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.[72]Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift towardRISCwith their ownAMD Am29000(29k) processor;[73]the 29k survived as anembedded processor.[74][75]The company also increased itsEPROMmemory market share in the late 1980s.[76]Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its 386-compatibleAm386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.[77]

In January 1996, AMD acquiredNexGenfor $857 million to develop what eventually becameAMD K6. At the time, NexGen was working on their Nx686 microprocessor.[78]

AMD had a large, successfulflash memorybusiness, even during thedotcom bust.[79]In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing intoSpansion, a joint venture withFujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993.[80][81]In December 2005, AMD divested itself of Spansion to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.[82]

Article: Intel

Intel Corporationis an American multinational technology company headquartered inSanta Clara, California. It designs, manufactures, and sells computer components such ascentral processing units(CPUs) and related products for business and consumer markets. Intel was the world'sthird-largest semiconductor chip manufacturerby revenue in 2024[3]and has been included in theFortune500list of thelargest United States corporations by revenuesince 2007. It was one of the first companies listed onNasdaq. Since 2025, Intel is partially owned by the United States government.

Intel suppliesmicroprocessorsfor most manufacturers of computer systems, and is one of the developers of thex86series of instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). It also manufactureschipsets,network interface controllers,flash memory,graphics processing units(GPUs),field-programmable gate arrays(FPGAs), and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel has a strong presence in the high-performance general-purpose and gaming PC market with itsIntel Coreline of CPUs, whose high-end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs, as well as itsIntel Arcseries of GPUs.

Intel was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneersGordon MooreandRobert Noyce, along with investorArthur Rock, and is associated with the executive leadership and vision ofAndrew Grove.[4]The company was a key component of the rise ofSilicon Valleyas ahigh-techcenter,[5]as well as being an early developer ofstatic(SRAM) anddynamic random-access memory(DRAM) chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip—theIntel 4004—in 1971, it was not until the success of the PC in the early 1990s that this became its primary business.

During the 1990s, the partnership betweenMicrosoft Windowsand Intel, known asWintel, became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape,[6][7]and solidified Intel's position on the market. As a result, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid to late 1990s, fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period, it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors, with a market share of 90%,[8]and was known for aggressive andanti-competitive tacticsin defense of its market position, particularly againstAMD, as well as a struggle withMicrosoftfor control over the direction of the PC industry.[9][10]Since the 2000s and especially the late 2010s, Intel has faced increasing competition from AMD, which has led to a decline in its dominance and market share in the PC market.[11]Nevertheless, with a 68.4% market share as of 2023, Intel still leads the x86 market by a wide margin.[12]

Intel was incorporated inMountain View, California, on July 18, 1968, byGordon E. Moore, achemist;Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of theintegrated circuit; andArthur Rock, an investor andventure capitalist.[13][14][15]Moore and Noyce had leftFairchild Semiconductor, where they were part of the "traitorous eight" who founded it. There were originally 500,000 shares outstanding of which Noyce bought 245,000 shares, Moore 245,000 shares, and Rock 10,000 shares; all at $1 per share. Rock offered $2,500,000 of convertible debentures to a limited group of private investors (equivalent to $21 million in 2022), convertible at $5 per share.[16][17]Two years later, Intel became apublic companyvia aninitial public offering(IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share). Intel was one of the first companies—and the oldest—to be listed on the then-newly establishedNational Association of Securities DealersAutomated Quotation System (NASDAQ).[18]Intel's third employee wasAndy Grove, achemical engineer, who ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.

In deciding on a name, Moore and Noyce quickly rejected "Moore Noyce",[19]a near-homophone for "more noise" – an ill-suited name for anelectronicscompany, sincenoise in electronicsis usually undesirable and typically associated with badinterference. Instead, they founded the company as NM Electronics on July 18, 1968, but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel, which stood for Integrated Electronics. Since "Intel" was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco, they had to buy the rights for the name.[18][20]

At its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to makelogic circuitsusingsemiconductor devices. The founders' goal was thesemiconductor memorymarket, widely predicted to replacemagnetic-core memory. Its first product, a quick entry into the small, high-speed memory market in 1969, was the 3101Schottky TTLbipolar64-bitstatic random-access memory(SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory inTsukuba, Japan.[21][22]In the same year, Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bitread-only memory(ROM)[23]and the first commercialmetal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor(MOSFET)silicon gateSRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101.[18][24][25]

While the 1101 was a significant advance, its complex staticcell structuremade it too slow and costly formainframememories. The three-transistorcell implemented in the first commercially availabledynamic random-access memory(DRAM), the1103released in 1970, solved these issues. The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972, as it replaced core memory in many applications.[26][27]Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.

Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor, theIntel 4004, in 1971.[18]The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry, as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer, which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do. Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could become the basis of what was first known as a "mini computer" and then a "personal computer".[28]Intel also created one of the firstmicrocomputersin 1973.[24][29]

Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972, in Malaysia, which would host multiple Intel operations, before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s, and manufacturing and development centers in China, India, and Costa Rica in the 1990s.[30]By the early 1980s, its business was dominated by DRAM chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of theIBMpersonal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.

By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growingpersonal computer market, Intel embarked on 10 years of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination. Moore handed over his position as CEO toAndy Grovein 1987. By launching its Intel Insidemarketing campaignin 1991, Intel was able to associatebrand loyaltywith consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line ofPentiumprocessors had become a household name.

As Intel exited other markets, the company depended so much on the 80386 and its successors that a marketing employee said that "there's only one product, and Andy Grove's the product manager".[31]After 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, most notablyAMD(Intel's largest competitor in its primaryx86architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range. Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced,[32]mostly due to the controversialNetBurstmicroarchitecture. In the early 2000s, then-CEO,Craig Barrettattempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.

Intel was embroiled in litigation for several years. U.S. law did not initially recognizeintellectual property rightsrelated to microprocessortopology(circuit layouts), until theSemiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and theSemiconductor Industry Association(SIA).[33]During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the80386CPU.[34]The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits.[34]Antitrustallegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMDbrought further claims against Intelrelated tounfair competition.

In 2005, CEOPaul Otellinireorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).

On June 6, 2005,Steve Jobs, then CEO ofApple, announced that Apple would be using Intel's x86 processors for itsMacintoshcomputers, switching from thePowerPCarchitecture developed by theAIM alliance.[35]This was seen as a win for Intel;[36]an analyst called the move "risky" and "foolish", as Intel's current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM.[37]

In 2006, Intel unveiled itsCoremicroarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim; the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field.[38][39]In 2008, Intel had another "tick" when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture, fabricated using the 45 nm process node. Later that year, Intel released a processor with theNehalemarchitecture to positive reception.[40]

On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel'sXScaleassets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business toMarvell Technology Groupfor an estimated $600 million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses, and theacquisitioncompleted on November 9, 2006.[41]

In 2008, Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company, SpectraWatt Inc. In 2011, SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy.[42]

In February 2011, Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility inChandler, Arizona, completed in 2013 at a cost of $5 billion.[43]The building is now the 10 nm-certified Fab 42 and is connected to the other Fabs (12, 22, 32) on Ocotillo Campus via an enclosed bridge known as the Link.[44][45][46][47]The company produces three-quarters of its products in the United States, although three-quarters of its revenue come from overseas.[48]

Article: GeForce

GeForceis abrandofgraphics processing units(GPUs) designed byNvidiaand marketed for the performance market. As of theGeForce 50 series, there have been nineteen iterations of the design.[clarification needed]In August 2017, Nvidia stated that "there are over 200 million GeForce gamers".[1]

The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on graphics boards, intended for the high-marginPC gamingmarket, and later diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, ranging from cost-sensitive[2]GPUs integrated on motherboards to mainstream add-in retail boards. Most recently,[when?]GeForce technology[vague]has been introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.[citation needed]

With respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce andAMD'sRadeonGPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. GeForce GPUs are very dominant in thegeneral-purpose graphics processor unit(GPGPU) market thanks to their proprietaryCompute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA).[3]GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complexbranchingcode).

The "GeForce" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in early 1999 called "Name That Chip". The company called out to the public to name the successor to theRIVA TNT2line of graphics boards. There were over 12,000 entries received and seven winners received a RIVA TNT2 Ultra graphics card as a reward.[4][5]Brian Burke, senior PR manager at Nvidia, toldMaximum PCin 2002 that "GeForce" originally stood for "Geometry Force" sinceGeForce 256was the first GPU for personal computers to calculate thetransform-and-lightinggeometry, offloading that function from theCPU.[6]

Launched in August 1999, the GeForce 256 was marketed as the "world's firstgraphics processing unit."[7]It used the NV10 graphics processor, which operated at 120 MHz, and featured 32MB of SDR video memory, operating at 166 MHz. The card also had a bus width of 128 bits.[8]Later, in December 1999, the GeForce 256 DDR was released, which had upgraded the video memory to 32 MB of DDR video memory, which allowed it to obtain a higher memory clock speed of 150 MHz.[9]Both the SDR and DDR variants of the graphics card featured 4 texture mapping units, 4 render output units, and 4 pixel shaders. The card also introduced an update to DirectX, which allowed it to have better visual effects and improved performance.[10]

Launched in March 2000, the first GeForce2 (NV15) was another high-performance graphics chip. Nvidia moved to a twin texture processor per pipeline (4x2) design, doubling texture fillrate per clock compared to GeForce 256. Later, Nvidia released the GeForce2 MX (NV11), which offered performance similar to the GeForce 256 but at a fraction of the cost. The MX was a compelling value in the low/mid-range market segments and was popular with OEM PC manufacturers and users alike. The GeForce 2 Ultra was the high-end model in this series.

Launched in February 2001, the GeForce3 (NV20) introduced programmablevertex and pixel shadersto the GeForce family and to consumer-level graphics accelerators. It had good overall performance and shader support, making it popular with enthusiasts although it never hit the midrange price point. TheNV2Adeveloped for theMicrosoftXboxgame console is a derivative of the GeForce 3.

Launched in February 2002, the then-high-end GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was mostly a refinement to the GeForce3. The biggest advancements included enhancements to anti-aliasing capabilities, an improved memory controller, a second vertex shader, and a manufacturing process size reduction to increase clock speeds. Another member of the GeForce 4 family, the budget GeForce4 MX was based on the GeForce2, with the addition of some features from the GeForce4 Ti. It targeted the value segment of the market and lacked pixel shaders. Most of these models used theAGP4× interface, but a few began the transition to AGP 8×.

Launched in 2003, the GeForce FX (NV30) was a huge change in architecture compared to its predecessors. The GPU was designed not only to support the new Shader Model 2 specification but also to perform well on older titles. However, initial models like the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra suffered from weakfloating pointshader performance and excessive heat which required infamously noisy two-slot cooling solutions. Products in this series carry the 5000 model number, as it is the fifth generation of the GeForce, though Nvidia marketed the cards as GeForce FX instead of GeForce 5 to show off "the dawn of cinematic rendering".

Launched in April 2004, the GeForce 6 (NV40) added Shader Model 3.0 support to the GeForce family, while correcting the weak floating point shader performance of its predecessor. It also implementedhigh-dynamic-range imagingand introducedSLI(Scalable Link Interface) andPureVideocapability (integrated partial hardware MPEG-2, VC-1, Windows Media Video, and H.264 decoding and fully accelerated video post-processing).

The seventh generation GeForce (G70/NV47) was launched in June 2005 and was the last Nvidia video card series that could support theAGPbus. The design was a refined version of GeForce 6, with the major improvements being a widened pipeline and an increase in clock speed. The GeForce 7 also offers new transparencysupersamplingand transparency multisampling anti-aliasing modes (TSAA and TMAA). These new anti-aliasing modes were later enabled for the GeForce 6 series as well. The GeForce 7950GT featured the highest performance GPU with an AGP interface in the Nvidia line. This era began the transition to the PCI-Express interface.

A 128-bit, eightrender output unit(ROP) variant of the 7800 GTX, called theRSX Reality Synthesizer, is used as the main GPU in the SonyPlayStation 3.

Released on November 8, 2006, the eighth-generation GeForce (originally called G80) was the first ever GPU to fully supportDirect3D10. Manufactured using a 90 nm process and built around the newTesla microarchitecture, it implemented theunified shader model. Initially just the 8800GTX model was launched, while the GTS variant was released months into the product line's life, and it took nearly six months for mid-range and OEM/mainstream cards to be integrated into the 8 series. The die shrink down to65 nmand a revision to the G80 design, codenamed G92, were implemented into the 8 series with the 8800GS, 8800GT and 8800GTS-512, first released on October 29, 2007, almost one whole year after the initial G80 release.

The first product was released on February 21, 2008.[11]Not even four months older than the initial G92 release, all 9-series designs are simply revisions to existing late 8-series products. The 9800GX2 uses two G92 GPUs, as used in later 8800 cards, in a dual PCB configuration while still only requiring a single PCI-Express 16x slot. The 9800GX2 utilizes two separate 256-bit memory busses, one for each GPU and its respective 512 MB of memory, which equates to an overall of 1 GB of memory on the card (although the SLI configuration of the chips necessitates mirroring the frame buffer between the two chips, thus effectively halving the memory performance of a 256-bit/512 MB configuration). The later 9800GTX features a single G92 GPU, 256-bit data bus, and 512 MB of GDDR3 memory.[12]

Prior to the release, no concrete information was known except that the officials claimed the next generation products had close to 1 TFLOPS processing power with the GPU cores still being manufactured in the 65 nm process, and reports about Nvidia downplaying the significance ofDirect3D10.1.[13]In March 2009, several sources reported that Nvidia had quietly launched a new series of GeForce products, namely the GeForce 100 Series, which consists of rebadged 9 Series parts.[14][15][16]GeForce 100 series products were not available for individual purchase.[2]

Based on the GT200 graphics processor consisting of 1.4 billion transistors, codenamed Tesla, the 200 series was launched on June 16, 2008.[17]The next generation of the GeForce series takes the card-naming scheme in a new direction, by replacing the series number (such as 8800 for 8-series cards) with the GTX or GTS suffix (which used to go at the end of card names, denoting their 'rank' among other similar models), and then adding model-numbers such as 260 and 280 after that. The series features the new GT200 core on a65nmdie.[18]The first products were the GeForce GTX 260 and the more expensive GeForce GTX 280.[19]The GeForce 310 was released on November 27, 2009, which is a rebrand of GeForce 210.[20][21]The 300 series cards are rebranded DirectX 10.1 compatible GPUs from the 200 series, which were not available for individual purchase.

On April 7, 2010, Nvidia released[22]the GeForce GTX 470 and GTX 480, the first cards based on the newFermi architecture, codenamed GF100; they were the first Nvidia GPUs to utilize 1 GB or more ofGDDR5memory. The GTX 470 and GTX 480 were heavily criticized due to high power use, high temperatures, and very loud noise that were not balanced by the performance offered, even though the GTX 480 was the fastest DirectX 11 card as of its introduction.

In November 2010, Nvidia released a new flagship GPU based on an enhanced GF100 architecture (GF110) called the GTX 580. It featured higher performance, less power utilization, heat and noise than the preceding GTX 480. This GPU received much better reviews than the GTX 480. Nvidia later also released the GTX 590, which packs two GF110 GPUs on a single card.

In September 2010, Nvidia announced that the successor toFermi microarchitecturewould be theKepler microarchitecture, manufactured with the TSMC 28 nm fabrication process. Earlier, Nvidia had been contracted to supply their top-end GK110 cores for use inOak Ridge National Laboratory's"Titan" supercomputer, leading to a shortage of GK110 cores. After AMD launched their own annual refresh in early 2012, the Radeon HD 7000 series, Nvidia began the release of the GeForce 600 series in March 2012. The GK104 core, originally intended for their mid-range segment of their lineup, became the flagship GTX 680. It introduced significant improvements in performance, heat, and power efficiency compared to the Fermi architecture and closely matched AMD's flagship Radeon HD 7970. It was quickly followed by the dual-GK104 GTX 690 and the GTX 670, which featured only a slightly cut-down GK104 core and was very close in performance to the GTX 680.

Radeon(/ˈreɪdiɒn/) is a brand of computer products, includinggraphics processing units,random-access memory,RAM disksoftware, and solid-state drives, produced by Radeon Technologies Group, a division ofAMD.[1]The brand was launched in 2000 byATI Technologies, which was acquired by AMD in 2006 for US$5.4 billion.

Radeon Graphics is the successor to theRageline. Four different families ofmicroarchitecturescan be roughly distinguished, thefixed-pipelinefamily, theunified shader model-families ofTeraScale,Graphics Core Next, andRDNA. ATI/AMD have developed different technologies, such asTruForm,HyperMemory,HyperZ,XGP,Eyefinityformulti-monitorsetups,PowerPlayfor power-saving,CrossFire(for multi-GPU) orHybrid Graphics. A range ofSIP blocksis also to be found on certain models in the Radeon products line:Unified Video Decoder,Video Coding EngineandTrueAudio.

The brand was previously only known as "ATI Radeon" until August 2010, when it was renamed to increase AMD's brand awareness on a global scale.[2]Products up to and including the HD 5000 series are branded as ATI Radeon, while the HD 6000 series and beyond use the new AMD Radeon branding.[3]

On 11 September 2015, AMD's GPU business was split into a separate unit known as Radeon Technologies Group, withRaja Kodurias Senior Vice President and chief architect.[1][4]

AMD does not distribute Radeon cards directly to consumers (though some exceptions can be found).[5]Instead, it sells Radeon GPUs to third-party manufacturers, who build and sell the Radeon-based video cards to the OEM and retail channels. Manufacturers of the Radeon cards—some of whom also make motherboards—includeASRock,Asus,Biostar,Club 3D,Diamond,Force3D,Gainward,Gigabyte,HIS,PowerColor,Sapphire,VisionTek, andXFX.

Early generations were identified with a number and major/minor alphabetic prefix. Later generations were assigned code names. New or heavily redesigned architectures have a prefix ofR(e.g.,R300orR600) while slight modifications are indicated by theRVprefix (e.g.,RV370orRV635).

The Radeon, first introduced in 2000, was ATI's first graphics processor to be fullyDirectX 7compliant.R100brought with it large gains in bandwidth and fill-rate efficiency through the newHyperZtechnology.

The RV200 was a die-shrink of the former R100 with some core logic tweaks for clockspeed, introduced in 2002. The only release in this generation was the Radeon 7500, which introduced little in the way of new features but offered substantial performance improvements over its predecessors.

ATI'ssecond generation Radeonincluded asophisticated pixel shaderarchitecture. This chipset implemented Microsoft's pixel shader 1.4 specification for the first time.

Its performance relative to competitors was widely perceived as weak, and subsequent revisions of this generation were cancelled to focus on development of the next generation.

The R300 was the firstGPUto fully support Microsoft's DirectX 9.0 technology upon its release in 2001. It incorporated fully programmable pixel and vertex shaders.

About a year later, the architecture was revised to allow for higher frequencies, more efficient memory access, and several other improvements in the R350 family. A budget line of RV350 products was based on this refreshed design with some elements disabled or removed.

Models using the newPCI Expressinterface were introduced in 2004. Using 110-nm and 130-nm manufacturing technologies under the X300 and X600 names, respectively, the RV370 and RV380 graphics processors were used extensively by consumer PC manufacturers.

While heavily based upon the previous generation, this line included extensions to the Shader Model 2 feature-set. Shader Model 2b, the specification ATI and Microsoft defined with this generation, offered somewhat more shader program flexibility.

ATI's DirectX 9.0c series of graphics cards, with completeshaderModel 3.0 support. Launched in October 2005, this series brought a number of enhancements including the floating point render target technology necessary forHDR renderingwithanti-aliasing.

ATI's first series of GPUs to replace the old fixed-pipeline and implementunified shader model. Subsequent revisions tuned the design for higher performance and energy efficiency, resulting in the ATI Mobility Radeon HD series for mobile computers.

Based on the R600 architecture. Mostly a bolstered with many more stream processors, with improvements to power consumption and GDDR5 support for the high-end RV770 and RV740(HD4770) chips. It arrived in late June 2008. The HD 4850 and HD 4870 have 800 stream processors and GDDR3 and GDDR5 memory, respectively. The 4890 was a refresh of 4870 with the same amount of stream processors yet higher clock rates due to refinements. The 4870x2 has 1600 stream processors and GDDR5 memory on an effective 512-bit memory bus with 230.4 Gbit/s video memory bandwidth available.

The series was launched on 23 September 2009. It featured a 40 nm fabrication process for the entire product line (only the HD4770 (RV740) was built on this process previously), with more stream cores and compatibility with the next major version of the DirectX API,DirectX 11, which launched on 22 October 2009 along withMicrosoftWindows 7. The Rxxx/RVxxx codename scheme was scrapped entirely. The initial launch consisted of only the 5870 and 5850 models. ATI released beta drivers that introduced full OpenGL 4.0 support on all variants of this series in March 2010.[6]

Article: PC game

Apersonal computer game, or abbreviatedPC game, also known as acomputer game,[a]is avideo gameplayed on apersonal computer(PC). The termPC gamehas been popularly used since the 1990s referring specifically to games on "Wintel" (Microsoft Windowssoftware/Intelhardware) which has dominated the computer industry since.

Mainframe and minicomputer games are a precursor to personal computer games.Home computergames became popular following thevideo game crash of 1983. In the 1990s, PC games lostmass markettraction toconsole gameson thefifth generationsuch as theSega Saturn,Nintendo 64andPlayStation.[citation needed]They are enjoying a resurgence in popularity since the mid-2000s throughdigital distributionononline service providers.[1][2]Personal computers as well as general computer software are considered synonymous withIBM PC compatiblesystems; whilemobile devices– smartphones and tablets, such as those running onAndroidoriOSplatforms– are also PCs in the general sense as opposed toconsoleorarcade machine. Historically, it also included games on systems fromApple Computer,Atari Corporation,Commodore Internationaland others.Microsoft WindowsutilizingDirect3Dbecome the most popular operating system for PC games in the 2000s. Games utilizing3D graphicsgenerally require a form ofgraphics processing unit, and PC games have been a major influencing factor for the development and marketing ofgraphics cards.Emulatorsare able to play games developed for other platforms. Thedemosceneoriginated from computer gamecracking.

The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market makes precisely assessing its size difficult.[1]PC remains the most important gaming platform with 60% ofdevelopersbeing most interested in developing a game for the platform and 66% of developers currently developing a game for PC.[3][better source needed]In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.[4][better source needed]According to research data provided byStatistain 2020 there were an estimated 1.75 billion PCgamersworldwide, up from 1.5 billion PC gaming users in the previous year.[5][better source needed]Newzoo reported that the PC gaming sector was the third-largest category across all platforms as of 2016[update], with the console sector second-largest, andmobile gamingsector biggest. 2.2 billion video gamers generate US$101.1 billion in revenue, excluding hardware costs. "Digital game revenues will account for $94.4 billion or 87% of the global gaming market.[6][7][better source needed]TheAPACregion was estimated to generate $46.6 billion in 2016, or 47% of total global video game revenues (note, not only "PC" games).Chinaalone accounts for half of APAC's revenues (at $24.4 billion), cementing its place as the largest video game market in the world, ahead of the US's anticipated market size of $23.5 billion.[citation needed]

Bertie the Brainwas one of the first game playing machines developed. It was built in 1950 byJosef Kates. It measured more than four meters tall, and was displayed at theCanadian National Exhibitionthat year.[8][non-primary source needed]

Although personal computers only became popular with the development of themicroprocessorandmicrocomputer, computer gaming onmainframesandminicomputershad previously already existed.OXO, an adaptation oftic-tac-toefor theEDSAC, debuted in 1952. Another pioneer computer game was developed in 1961, whenMITstudents Martin Graetz andAlan Kotok, withMITstudentSteve Russell, developedSpacewar!on aPDP-1mainframe computerused for statistical calculations.[9]

The first generation of computer games were oftentext-basedadventuresorinteractive fiction, in which the player communicated with the computer by entering commands through a keyboard. An early text-adventure,Adventure, was developed for thePDP-11minicomputerby Will Crowther in 1976, and expanded by Don Woods in 1977.[10]By the 1980s, personal computers had become powerful enough to run games likeAdventure, but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games. Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSIGold Boxgames such asPool of Radiance, orThe Bard's Tale, for example.

By the late 1970s to early 1980s, games were developed and distributed throughhobbyistgroups and gaming magazines, such asCreative Computingand laterComputer Gaming World. These publications providedgame code that could be typed into a computerand played, encouraging readers to submit their own software to competitions.[11]Players could modify theBASICsource code of even commercial games.[12]Microchesswas one of the first games formicrocomputerswhich was sold to the public. First sold in 1977, Microchess eventually sold over 50,000 copies oncassette tape.

As withsecond-generationvideo game consolesat the time, early home computer game companies capitalized onsuccessful arcade gamesat the time withportsorclonesof populararcade video games.[13][14]By 1982, thetop-selling gamesfor theAtari 8-bit computerswere ports ofFroggerandCentipede, while the top-selling game for theTI-99/4Awas theSpace InvaderscloneTI Invaders.[13]That same year,Pac-Manwas ported to the Atari 8-bit computers,[14]whileDonkey Kongwas licensed for theColeco Adam.[15]In late 1981,Atari, Inc.attempted to take legal action against unauthorizedPac-Manclones, despite some of these predating Atari's exclusive rights to the home versions ofNamco's game.[14][16]Thousands of children attended the 1982West Coast Computer Faireto see computer games there, despite organizers warning that the convention "is designed for mature individuals".[17]

As the American video game market became flooded with poor-quality cartridge games created by numerous companies attempting to enter the market, and overproduction of high-profile releases such as theAtari 2600adaptations ofPac-ManandE.T.grossly underperformed, the popularity of personal computers for education rose dramatically. In 1983, American consumer interest in console video games dwindled to historical lows, as interest in games on personal computers rose.[18]The effects of the crash were largely limited to the console market, as established companies such asAtariposted record losses over subsequent years. Conversely, the home computer market boomed, as sales of low-cost color computers such as theCommodore 64rose to record highs and developers such asElectronic Artsbenefited from increasing interest in the platform.[18]

The North American console market experienced a resurgence in the United States with the release of theNintendo Entertainment System(NES). In Europe, computer gaming continued to boom for many years after.[18]Computers such as theZX SpectrumandBBC Microwere successful in the European market, where the NES was not as successful despite its monopoly in Japan and North America. The only8-bit consoleto have any success in Europe would be theMaster System.[19]Meanwhile, in Japan, both consoles and computers became major industries, with the console market dominated byNintendoand the computer market dominated byNEC'sPC-88(1981) andPC-98(1982). A key difference between Western and Japanese computers at the time was thedisplay resolution, with Japanese systems using a higher resolution of 640x400 to accommodateJapanese text, which in turn affectedvideo game designand allowed more detailed graphics. Japanese computers were also usingYamaha'sFM synthsound boardsfrom the early 1980s.[20]

To enhance theimmersiveexperience with their unrealistic graphics and electronic sound, early PC games included extras such as the peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped withThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyor thescience fictionnovella included withElite. These extras gradually became less common, but many games were still sold in the traditional oversized boxes that used to hold the extra "feelies". Today, such extras are usually found only in Special Edition versions of games, such as Battle chests fromBlizzard.[21]

During the16-bit era, theAmigaandAtari STbecame popular in Europe, theMacintoshandIBM PC compatiblesbecame popular in North America, while the PC-98,X68000, andFM Townsbecame popular in Japan. TheAmiga,X68000andFM Townswere capable of producing neararcade-quality hardwarespritegraphics and sound quality when they first released in the mid-to-late 1980s.[20]

Amonglaunch titlesfor theIBM Personal Computer(PC) in 1981 wasMicrosoft Adventure, which IBM described as bringing "players into a fantasy world of caves and treasures".[22]BYTEthat year stated that the computer's speed and sophistication made it "an excellent gaming device", and IBM and others sold games likeMicrosoft Flight Simulator. The PC'sCGA graphicsandspeaker soundwere poor, however, and most customers bought the powerful but expensive computer for business.[23][24]OneComputerLandowner estimated in 1983 that a quarter of corporate executives with computers "have a game hidden somewhere in their drawers",[25]andInfoWorldin 1984 reported that "in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers are playing games on their computers",[26][27]but software companies found selling games for the PC difficult; an observer said that year thatFlight Simulatorhad sold hundreds of thousands of copies because customers with corporate PCs could claim that it was a "simulation".[28]

From mid-1985, however, whatCompute!described as a "wave" of inexpensiveIBM PC clonesfrom American and Asian companies, such as theTandy 1000and theLeading Edge Model D, caused prices to decline; by the end of 1986, the equivalent to a $1600 real IBM PC with 256K RAM and two disk drives cost as little as $600, lower than the price of theApple IIc. Consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers. While often purchased to do work on evenings and weekends, clones' popularity caused consumer-software companies to increase the number of IBM-compatible products, including those developed specifically for the PC as opposed toportingfrom other computers.Bing GordonofElectronic Artsreported that customers used computers for games more than one fifth of the time whether purchased for work or a hobby, with many who purchased computers for other reasons finding PC games "a pretty satisfying experience".[29]

PC game sales rose by 198% year over year in the first half of 1987, compared to 57% for the market overall. The formerly business-only computer had become the largest and fastest-growing, and most important platform for computer game companies. More than a third of games sold in North America were for the PC, twice as many as those for the Apple II and even outselling those for the Commodore 64.[27][30]By 1988Computer Gaming Worldagreed withJoel BillingsofStrategic Simulationsthat an inexpensive clone withEGA graphicswas superior for games.[31][32]The Tandy 1000'senhanced graphics, sound, and built-in joystick ports made it the best platform for IBM PC-compatible games before the VGA era.[24]

By 1988, the enormous popularity of theNintendo Entertainment Systemhad greatly affected the computer-game industry. AKoeiexecutive claimed that "Nintendo's success has destroyed the [computer] software entertainment market". AMindscapeexecutive agreed, saying that "Unfortunately, its effect has been extremely negative. Without question, Nintendo's success has eroded software sales. There's been a much greater falling off of disk sales than anyone anticipated." A third attributed the end of growth in sales of theCommodore 64to the console, andTrip Hawkinscalled Nintendo "the last hurrah of the 8-bit world". Experts were unsure whether it affected 16-bit computer games,[33]but games lost shelf space at computer software stores, and many of the hundreds of computer-game companies went out of business. Hawkins said that while foreign videogame competition increased, "there's an increase in product supply without an increase in demand".[34]He in 1990 had to deny rumors that Electronic Arts would withdraw from computers and only produce console games.[35]By 1993,ASCII Entertainmentreported at aSoftware Publishers Associationconference that the market for console games ($5.9 billion in revenue) was 12 times that of the computer-game market ($430 million).[36]

However, computer games did not disappear. The industry hoped that theCD-ROMand otheroptical storagetechnology would increase computers'user friendlinessand allow for more sophisticated games.[34]By 1989,Computer Gaming Worldreported that "the industry is moving toward heavy use ofVGA graphics".[37]While some games were advertised withVGAsupport at the start of the year, they usually supported EGA graphics through VGA cards. By the end of 1989, however, most publishers moved to supporting at least 320x200MCGA, a subset of VGA.[38]VGA gave the PC graphics that outmatched the Amiga. Increasing adoption of thecomputer mouse, driven partially by the success ofadventure gamessuch as the highly successfulKing's Questseries, and high resolutionbitmapdisplays allowed the industry to include increasingly high-qualitygraphical interfacesin new releases.

Further improvements to game artwork and audio were made possible with the introduction ofFM synthesissound.Yamahabegan manufacturing FM synth boards for computers in the early-mid-1980s, and by 1985, the NEC andFM-7computers had built-in FM sound.[20]The first PCsound cards, such asAdLib's Music Synthesizer Card, soon appeared in 1987. These cards allowedIBM PC compatiblecomputers to produce complex sounds using FM synthesis, where they had previously been limited to simple tones and beeps. However, the rise of theCreative LabsSound Blastercard, released in 1989, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of aPCMchannel anddigital signal processor, led AdLib to file for bankruptcy by 1992. Also in 1989, theFM Townscomputer included built-in PCM sound, in addition to aCD-ROMdrive and24-bit colorgraphics.[20]

In the late 80s and throughout the entire 1990s decade, DOS was one of the most popular gaming platforms in regions where it was officially sold.[39]

Article: Computer cooling

Computer coolingis required to remove thewaste heatproduced bycomputer hardware, to keep components within permissibleoperating temperaturelimits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated includeintegrated circuitssuch ascentral processing units(CPUs),chipsets,graphics cards,hard disk drives, andsolid state drives(SSDs).

Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use ofheatsinkscooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots.Computer fansare widely used along with heatsink fans to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also other cooling techniques, such asliquid cooling. All modern day processors are designed to cut out or reduce their voltage or clock speed if the internal temperature of the processor exceeds a specified limit. This is generally known as Thermal Throttling in the case of reduction of clock speeds, or Thermal Shutdown in the case of a complete shutdown of the device or system.

Cooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer, such as by exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly individually cooled include the CPU,graphics processing unit(GPU) and thenorthbridge.

Integrated circuits(e.g. CPU and GPU) are the main generators of heat in modern computers. Heat generation can be reduced by efficient design and selection of operating parameters such as voltage and frequency, but ultimately, acceptable performance can often only be achieved by managing significant heat generation.

In operation, the temperature of a computer's components will rise until the heat transferred to the surroundings is equal to the heat produced by the component, that is, whenthermal equilibriumis reached. For reliable operation, the temperature must never exceed a specified maximum permissible value unique to each component. For semiconductors, instantaneousjunction temperature, rather than component case, heatsink, or ambient temperature is critical.

Because high temperatures can significantly reduce life span or cause permanent damage to components, and the heat output of components can sometimes exceed the computer's cooling capacity, manufacturers often take additional precautions to ensure that temperatures remain within safe limits. A computer withthermal sensorsintegrated in the CPU, motherboard, chipset, or GPU can shut itself down when high temperatures are detected to prevent permanent damage, although this may not completely guarantee long-term safe operation. Before an overheating component reaches this point, it may be "throttled" until temperatures fall below a safe point usingdynamic frequency scalingtechnology. Throttling reduces the operating frequency and voltage of an integrated circuit or disables non-essential features of the chip to reduce heat output, often at the cost of slightly or significantly reduced performance. For desktop and notebook computers, throttling is often controlled at theBIOSlevel. Throttling is also commonly used to manage temperatures in smartphones and tablets, where components are packed tightly together with little to no active cooling, and with additional heat transferred from the hand of the user.[1]

The user can also perform several tasks in order to preemptively prevent damage from happening. They can perform a visual inspection of the cooler and case fans. If any of them are not spinning correctly, it is likely that they will need to be replaced. The user should also clean the fans thoroughly, since dust and debris can increase the ambient case temperature and impact fan performance. The best way to do so is with compressed air in an open space. Another preemptive technique to prevent damage is to replace the thermal paste regularly.[2]

As electronic computers became larger and more complex, cooling of the active components became a critical factor for reliable operation. Early vacuum-tube computers, with relatively large cabinets, could rely on natural or forced air circulation for cooling. However, solid-state devices were packed much more densely and had lower allowable operating temperatures.

Starting in 1965,IBMand other manufacturers of mainframe computers sponsored intensive research into the physics of cooling densely packed integrated circuits. Many air and liquid cooling systems were devised and investigated, using methods such as natural and forced convection, direct air impingement, direct liquid immersion and forced convection, pool boiling, falling films, flow boiling, and liquid jet impingement. Mathematical analysis was used to predict temperature rises of components for each possible cooling system geometry.[3]

IBM developed three generations of the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) which used a water-cooled cold plate in direct thermal contact with integrated circuit packages. Each package had a thermally conductive pin pressed onto it, and helium gas surrounded chips and heat-conducting pins. The design could remove up to 27 watts from a chip and up to 2000 watts per module, while maintaining chip package temperatures of around 50 °C (122 °F). Systems using TCMs were the3081family (1980),ES/3090(1984) and some models of theES/9000(1990).[3]In the IBM 3081 processor, TCMs allowed up to 2700 watts on a singleprinted circuit boardwhile maintaining chip temperature at 69 °C (156 °F).[4]Thermal conduction modules using water cooling were also used in mainframe systems manufactured by other companies including Mitsubishi and Fujitsu.

TheCray-1supercomputerdesigned in 1976 had a distinctive cooling system. The machine was only 77 inches (2,000 mm) in height and56+1⁄2inches (1,440 mm) in diameter, and consumed up to 115 kilowatts; this is comparable to the average power consumption of a few dozen Western homes or a medium-sized car. The integrated circuits used in the machine were the fastest available at the time, usingemitter-coupled logic; however, the speed was accompanied by high power consumption compared to laterCMOSdevices.

Heat removal was critical.Refrigerantwas circulated through piping embedded in vertical cooling bars in twelve columnar sections of the machine. Each of the 1662 printed circuit modules of the machine had a copper core and was clamped to the cooling bar. The system was designed to maintain the cases of integrated circuits at no more than 54 °C (129 °F), with refrigerant circulating at 21 °C (70 °F). Final heat rejection was through a water-cooled condenser.[5]Piping, heat exchangers, and pumps for the cooling system were arranged in an upholstered bench seat around the outside of the base of the computer. About 20 percent of the machine's weight in operation was refrigerant.[6]

In the later Cray-2, with its more densely packed modules, Seymour Cray had trouble effectively cooling the machine using the metal conduction technique with mechanical refrigeration, so he switched to 'liquid immersion' cooling. This method involved filling the chassis of the Cray-2 with a liquid calledFluorinert. Fluorinert, as its name implies, is an inert liquid that does not interfere with the operation of electronic components. As the components came to operating temperature, the heat would dissipate into the Fluorinert, which was pumped out of the machine to achilled waterheat exchanger.[7]

Performance per wattof modern systems has greatly improved; many more computations can be carried out with a given power consumption than was possible with the integrated circuits of the 1980s and 1990s. Recent supercomputer projects such asBlue Generely on air cooling, which reduces cost, complexity, and size of systems compared to liquid cooling.

Fans are used when natural convection is insufficient to remove heat. Fans may be fitted to thecomputer caseor attached to CPUs, GPUs, chipsets,power supplyunits (PSUs),hard drives, or as cards plugged into an expansion slot. Common fan sizes include 40, 60, 80, 92, 120, and 140 mm. 200, 230, 250 and 300 mm fans are sometimes used in high-performance personal computers.

A computer has a certain resistance to air flowing through the chassis and components. This is the sum of all the smaller impediments to air flow, such as the inlet and outlet openings, air filters, internal chassis, and electronic components. Fans are simple air pumps that provide pressure to the air of the inlet side relative to the output side. That pressure difference moves air through the chassis, with air flowing to areas of lower pressure.

Fans generally have two published specifications: free air flow and maximum differential pressure. Free air flow is the amount of air a fan will move with zero back-pressure. Maximum differential pressure is the amount of pressure a fan can generate when completely blocked. In between these two extremes are a series of corresponding measurements of flow versus pressure which is usually presented as a graph. Each fan model will have a unique curve, like the dashed curves in the adjacent illustration.[8]

Fans can be installed parallel to each other, in series, or a combination of both. Parallel installation would be fans mounted side by side. Series installation would be a second fan in line with another fan such as an inlet fan and an exhaust fan. To simplify the discussion, it is assumed the fans are the same model.

Article: Overclocking

Incomputing,overclockingis the practice of increasing theclock rateof asemiconductor device, such as aprocessor, beyond its rated speed, potentially increasing itsperformance.[1]Overclocked devices, however, may have shorter lifespans, become unstable and unreliable, and in extreme cases, be permanently damaged. Many manufacturers do not cover damage from overclocking in theirwarranties, while some allow it inside a predefined safety margin.

A semiconductor device's processing speed depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, its clock speed,microarchitecture, the kind ofsoftwareit's running, and thebandwidth,latencyand size foreach level ofitsmemory. All else being equal, a faster-clocked device can, though not necessarily, perform faster. Operatingvoltageis often increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. Operating at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat.[2]Overclocking a device introduces additional risks of failure, for example, by overheating when the increased heat load is not removed,[2]or by the device requesting more power than its power supply can provide.[citation needed]

Conversely, the primary goal ofunderclockingis to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allowquieter operation, and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency.[3]

Underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a "standard-voltage" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a "standard voltage" processor in a "low voltage" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified lowvoltageversion. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used whentroubleshooting.[4]

Overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more byenthusiaststhan professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughlybeforeemploying them into a production environment cannot be overstated.

Overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.

Some hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and "Hot-Rodding" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasingsystem requirementsand extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is alreadydepreciated, and would have needed to be replaced in any case.[5]

While stock cooling systems are commonly designed for heat produced during non-overclocked use, they may not be adequate for overclocked parts. These may include the use of additional and more powerfulfans, larger and more efficientheat sinks,heat pipes, or the use ofwater cooling.

Heat sinks are passiveheat exchangersdesigned to take away excessive heat generated by the device it is in physical contact with. They are commonly made withcopperoraluminum, with copper having higherthermal conductivity, and aluminum being less effcient but also cheaper.[6]Heat pipescan be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.[6]

Other cooling methods areforced convectionandphase transitioncooling which is used inrefrigeratorsand can be adapted for computer use.Liquid nitrogen,liquid helium, anddry iceare used as coolants in extreme cases,[7]such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system. In June 2006,IBMandGeorgia Institute of Technologyjointly announced a new record in silicon-based chipclock rate(the rate a transistor can be switched at, not the CPU clock rate[8]) above 500 GHz, which was done by cooling the chip to 4.5K(−268.6°C; −451.6°F) using liquid helium.[9]Set in November 2012, the CPU Frequency World Record is 9008.82 MHz as of December 2022.[10]These extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term, as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant, andcondensationcan form on chilled components.[7]Moreover,silicon-basedjunction gate field-effect transistors(JFET) will degrade below temperatures of roughly 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) and eventually cease to function or "freeze out" at 40 K (−233 °C; −388 °F) since the silicon ceases to be semiconducting,[11]so using extremely cold coolants may cause devices to fail.Blowtorchis used to temporarily raise temperature to issues of over-cooling when not desirable.[12][13]

Submersion cooling, used by theCray-2supercomputer, involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has lowelectrical conductivity. The advantage of this technique is that no condensation can form on components.[14]A good submersion liquid isFluorinertmade by3M, which is expensive. Another option ismineral oil, but impurities such as those in water might cause it to conduct electricity.[14]

Amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture ofdry iceand a solvent with a low freezing point, such asacetoneorisopropyl alcohol.[15]Thiscooling bath, often used in laboratories, achieves a temperature of −78 °C (−108 °F).[16]

As an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk issilent data corruptionby undetected errors. Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications,device drivers, or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.

A large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.[17]

In general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor.[18]

To further complicate matters, in process technologies such assilicon on insulator(SOI), devices displayhysteresis—a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same. Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.[19]

Overclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer. Ifmanufacturing yieldis high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons. In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold. Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.

Notably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often. In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer. Pentium architectBob Colwellcalls overclocking an "uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation".[20]

Overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.

Article: Computer performance

Incomputing,computer performanceis the amount of useful work accomplished by acomputer system. Outside of specific contexts, computer performance is estimated in terms of accuracy,efficiencyand speed of executingcomputer programinstructions. When it comes to high computer performance, one or more of the following factors might be involved:

The performance of any computer system can be evaluated in measurable, technical terms, using one or more of the metrics listed above. This way the performance can be

Whilst the above definition relates to a scientific, technical approach, the following definition given byArnold Allenwould be useful for a non-technical audience:

The wordperformancein computer performance means the same thing that performance means in other contexts, that is, it means "How well is the computer doing the work it is supposed to do?"[1]

Computer softwareperformance, particularlysoftware applicationresponse time, is an aspect ofsoftware qualitythat is important inhuman–computer interactions.

Performance engineering within systems engineering encompasses the set of roles, skills, activities, practices, tools, and deliverables applied at every phase of the systems development life cycle which ensures that a solution will be designed, implemented, and operationally supported to meet the performance requirements defined for the solution.

Performance engineering continuously deals with trade-offs between types of performance.  Occasionally aCPU designercan find a way to make aCPUwith better overall performance by improving one of the aspects of performance, presented below, without sacrificing the CPU's performance in other areas.  For example, building the CPU out of better, fastertransistors.

However, sometimes pushing one type of performance to an extreme leads to a CPU with worse overall performance, because other important aspects were sacrificed to get one impressive-looking number, for example, the chip'sclock rate(see themegahertz myth).

Application Performance Engineering (APE) is a specific methodology withinperformance engineeringdesigned to meet the challenges associated with application performance in increasingly distributed mobile, cloud and terrestrial IT environments. It includes the roles, skills, activities, practices, tools and deliverables applied at every phase of the application lifecycle that ensure an application will be designed, implemented and operationally supported to meet non-functional performance requirements.

Computer performancemetrics(things to measure) includeavailability,response time,channel capacity,latency,completion time,service time,bandwidth,throughput,relative efficiency,scalability,performance per watt,compression ratio,instruction path lengthandspeed up.CPUbenchmarks are available.[2]

Availability of a system is typically measured as a factor of its reliability - as reliability increases, so does availability (that is, lessdowntime). Availability of a system may also be increased by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability and maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, it is likely to dominate the availability (prediction uncertainty) problem, even while maintainability levels are very high.

Response time is the total amount of time it takes to respond to a request for service. In computing, that service can be any unit of work from a simpledisk IOto loading a complexweb page. The response time is the sum of three numbers:[3]

Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normallyIntelIA-32architecture) to be able to run a large base of pre-existing, pre-compiled software.  Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks, some of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency (seemegahertz myth).

Channel capacity is the tightest upper bound on the rate ofinformationthat can be reliably transmitted over acommunications channel. By thenoisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate (in units ofinformationper unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability.[4][5]

Information theory, developed byClaude E. ShannonduringWorld War II, defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which one can compute it. The key result states that the capacity of the channel, as defined above, is given by the maximum of themutual informationbetween the input and output of the channel, where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution.[6]

Latency is a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed. Latency is a result of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can take place. This velocity is always lower or equal to speed of light. Therefore, every physical system that has non-zero spatial dimensions will experience some sort of latency.

The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed and the nature of stimulation. In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used for communications. In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate that information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is "in-flight" at any one moment. In the field of human-machine interaction, perceptible latency (delay between what the user commands and when the computer provides the results) has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability.

Computers run sets of instructions called a process. In operating systems, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing. In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding. For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000 Hz. The operating system may choose to adjust the scheduling of each transition (high-low or low-high) based on an internal clock. The latency is the delay between the process instruction commanding the transition and the hardware actually transitioning the voltage from high to low or low to high.

System designers buildingreal-time computingsystems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has lowinterrupt latencyand when it has a deterministic response.

Agaming computer, also known as agaming PC, is a specializedpersonal computerdesigned for playingPC gamesat high standards. They typically differ from mainstream personal computers by using high-performancegraphics cards, a high core-countCPUwith higher rawperformanceand higher-performanceRAM. Gaming PCs are also used for other demanding tasks such asvideo editing.[2]While often indesktopform, gaming PCs may also belaptopsorhandhelds.

TheNimrod, designed byJohn Makepeace Bennett, built by Raymond Stuart-Williams and exhibited in the 1951 Festival of Britain, is regarded as the first gaming computer. Bennett did not intend for it to be a real gaming computer, however, as it was supposed to be an exercise in mathematics as well as to prove computers could "carry out very complex practical problems", not purely for enjoyment.[3]

Few years later,game consoleslike theMagnavox Odyssey(released in 1972) and theAtari 2600(released 1977) were the basis of the future of not just gaming consoles, but gaming computers as well with their increasing popularity with families everywhere.[4]The first "modern" computer was made in 1942, theAtanasoff–Berry Computer(ABC for short). Unlike moderndesktopsandlaptops, the ABC was a gargantuan machine that occupied "1,800 square feet… weighing almost 50 tons",.[5]When theApple IIand theCommodore 64were released in 1977 and 1982 respectively, personal computers became more appealing for general consumer use.[6]TheCommodore 64was an affordable and relatively powerful computer for its time in 1982,[7]featuring anMOS Technology 6510CPU with 64 kb ofRAM. It could display up to "40 columns and 25 lines of text" along with 16 colors on its 320x200 resolution screen.[8]The Apple II cost around US$1,298 in 1977 ($5,633 adjusted for inflation in 2021) and the Commodore 64 cost aroundUS$595(equivalent to $1,939 in 2024), making it expensive for most consumers.[9][10]However, their overall computing power, efficiency, and compact size was more advanced from even the most advanced computers at the time.[11][12]

IBM PC-compatibleshave been the dominant types of PCs globally, both mainstream and by extension in gaming, since the 1990s. During that decade a number of special PC product lines were created byOEMsthat focused on pre-built gaming desktop computers, such asAlienware, formed in 1997; andHPwith theirOMENdivision, whose lineage dates back to 1991 under the defunct brandVoodooPC; and both of which continue to be marketed today.

From the mid-1990s as3Dgaming was taking off, companies like3dfx(with their Voodoo) andNvidia(with theirRIVA 128) advanced the market with their new graphical processing units.[13]

More manufacturers started making gaming PC lines (or were started for this purpose) during the 2000s and 2010s, such asToshiba's now-defunctQosmio;Asus's ROG (Republic of Gamers) and TUF;Acer'sPredatorline;Lenovo'sLegion; andRazer. During this time, gaming laptops started to gain popularity.[14]More recently in the 2020s, portable handheld gaming PCs have started to gain traction that run on full desktopx86(thede factostandard) platforms. These began with GPD'sWinand Alienware's UFO concept, inspired by theNintendo Switch(which is not a PC), and have been popularized byValve Corporation'sSteam Deck.[15][16][17]

65.1 million gaming products have been sold overall as of 2021, of which 27.9 million are gamingnotebooks, 19.7 million are gamingmonitors, and 17.5 million are gamingdesktops.[18]

Technically, any computer can be considered a "gaming computer"; however the most common ones are typically based around anx86-basedCPUwith agraphics accelerator card, a sufficient amount of high-performanceRAM, and faststorage drives.

In adesktop configuration, acaseis also needed, and gaming cases are often modified or manufactured with extraLEDlights or see-through panels for aesthetic reasons.[19][20]Individual components are typically attached to amotherboardthrough differentbus slots, including the CPU, RAM, and graphics card, or wired to it withSATAorIDEcabling (for hard disks oroptical drives).[21]Laptopsalso share a similar format, but with smaller and less power hungry components.

Gamers and computer enthusiasts may choose tooverclocktheir CPUs and GPUs in order to gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling, usually byair coolingorwater cooling.[22]

These configurations mostly dates back to the 1990s whenIntelandMicrosoftfirst began todominate the PC marketplace, and has not changed significantly since then.[23]Hardware specs continue to improve over time due to the graphical demands of games, especially with architectural and other changes within CPU andGPUdesigns.

Senior editorofTom's HardwareAndrew Freedman says that "Gaming rigs aren't one-size fits all", and that there are certain instances where a gaming desktop will be more appropriate than a laptop and other circumstances where a laptop is more appropriate than a desktop.[24]Each platform has its pros and cons, which may change depending on a person's needs. For example, someone looking for maximum portability may choose a laptop over a desktop since it is all self-contained in one unit, whereas a desktop setup is split up into multiple components: a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and the desktop itself. Freedman states that laptops are ideal candidates forLAN parties, especially ones equipped with "Nvidia's Max-Q GPUs" which "can easily fit into a backpack and don't pack outrageously large chargers".[24]

Gamingdesktop computersare the most versatile types of gaming computers. People usually buy gaming PCs because they want the performance that is expected of them. The majority of this potential lies in the parts of desktops, which can be overclocked for more performance, as well as being able to withstand abuse thanks to their higher durability.[24]The large chassis on a desktop also allows for morefans, for improved cooling and heat dissipation, which would ultimately lead to improved gaming performance.[25]

Pre-built desktops, may use "proprietary motherboards that aren't standard sizes". These uniquely shaped motherboards can limit the owner's capability to upgrade components in the future, but they can still generally change out "the RAM, GPU and… CPU".[26]Razer Inc.'s project Christine (2014) proposes the use of modules to allow for fast replacement of computer parts.[27]

Laptopgaming computers give the ability for gaming on portable computers. The usable space inside a laptop is much more limited compared to a desktop. There are also fewer items that can be changed out on a laptop than a desktop, like RAM and storage, compared to a desktop where almost all the components, including motherboards and CPUs, can be swapped out with the latest technology available at the time.[24]

Handheld PCsbuilt for gaming are a relatively recent form factor. Due to their mobile chassis, they are the most limited types of gaming computers as components generally can't be upgraded. Handheld gaming PCs may come with a physical keyboard or may discard it entirely to be styled like ahandheld gaming console.[17]

As stated before, there are options PC gamers take into account when deciding to build their own unit versus buying a pre-built one. There are not many options when it comes to the laptop configuration but they do exist. Jason Clarke, a contributor to Chillblast, mentioned that there are a number of builders that deal specifically with laptops, with some adding configurable features that were not originally there, such as being able to change CPUs and GPUs.[28]These PC builders build from scratch, and the possibility to change out CPUs and GPUs after they have been installed is unlikely. Clarke also advised that people should and cannot build their own laptops because of how complex and compact everything is.[29]

Many PC gamers and journalists, like Clarke and Freedman, advise people to start with gaming desktops as they are the way to go when seeking pure performance. Pre-built desktops like Alienware'sAurora R11are ready-to-go systems with a history behind them, but some claim that their systems are over-priced. This is mainly due to the cost of building the PC and ease of access for components for the consumer. Marshall Honorof, a writer for Tom's Guide, explains that the steps on how to build a gaming PC from scratch "can be a daunting process, particularly for newcomers" but it could be one of the best technological decisions someone can make. According to his research, Honorof found that $1,500 is enough to buy a "powerful, but not quite top-of-the-line" computer and one can choose his or her own components.[30]

Article: Workstation

Aworkstationis a special computer designed for technical orscientificapplications.[2]Intended primarily to be used by a single user,[2]they are commonly connected to alocal area networkand runmulti-useroperating systems. The termworkstationhas been used loosely to refer to everything from amainframe computerterminal to aPCconnected to anetwork, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such asSun Microsystems,[3]Silicon Graphics,Apollo Computer,[4]DEC,HP,NeXT, andIBMwhich powered the3D computer graphicsrevolution of the late 1990s.[5]

Workstations formerly offered higher performance specifications than mainstreampersonal computers, especially in terms ofprocessing,graphics, memory, and multitasking. Workstations are optimized for thevisualizationand manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulations likecomputational fluid dynamics,animation,video editing,image editing,medical imaging, image rendering,computational science, generatingmathematical plots, andsoftware development. Typically, theform factoris that of adesktop computer, which consists of a high-resolution display, akeyboard, and amouseat a minimum, but also offers multiple displays,graphics tablets, and3D micefor manipulating objects and navigating scenes.  Workstations were the first segment of the computer market[6]to present advanced accessories, and collaboration tools likevideoconferencing.[5]

The increasing capabilities of mainstream PCs since the late 1990s have reduced distinction between the PCs and workstations.[7]Typical 1980s workstations have expensive proprietary hardware and operating systems to categorically distinguish from standardized PCs. From the 1990s and 2000s,IBM'sRS/6000andIntelliStationhaveRISC-basedPOWERCPUs runningAIX, versus its corporateIBM PC Seriesand consumerAptivaPCs that have Intel x86 CPUs and usually runningMicrosoft Windows. However, by the early 2000s, this difference largely disappeared, since workstations use highlycommoditizedhardware dominated by large PC vendors, such asDell,HP Inc., andFujitsu, sellingx86-64systems runningWindowsorLinux.

Workstations are older than the firstpersonal computer(PC).[8]The first computer that might qualify as a workstation is theIBM 1620, a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console.[9]It was introduced in 1959.[10]One peculiar feature of the machine is that it lacks any arithmetic circuitry.[11]To perform addition, it requires a memory-resident table of decimal addition rules.[12]This reduced the cost of logic circuitry, enabling IBM to make it inexpensive. The machine iscodenamedCADET and was initially rented for $1000 per month.

In 1965, theIBM 1130scientific computer became the successor to 1620. Both of these systems runFortranand other languages.[13]They are built into roughly desk-sized cabinets, with console typewriters. They have optional add-on disk drives, printers, and both paper-tape and punched-card I/O.

Early workstations were generally dedicatedminicomputers, a multiuser system reserved for one user.[8]For example, thePDP-8fromDigital Equipment Corporation(DEC), is regarded as the first commercial minicomputer.[14]

Workstations have historically been more advanced than contemporary PCs, with more powerful CPU architectures, earlier networking, more advanced graphics, more memory, and multitasking with sophisticated operating systems like Unix. Because of their minicomputer heritage, from the start workstations have run professional and expensive software such as CAD and graphics design, as opposed to PCs' games and text editors.[8]TheLisp machinesdeveloped atMITin the early 1970s pioneered some workstation principles, as high-performance, networked, single-user systems intended for heavily interactive use. Lisp Machines were commercialized beginning 1980 by companies likeSymbolics,Lisp Machines,Texas Instruments(theTI Explorer), andXerox(theInterlisp-Dworkstations). The first computer designed for a single user, with high-resolution graphics (and so a workstation in the modern sense), is theAltodeveloped atXerox PARCin 1973.[15]Other early workstations include theTerak 8510/a(1977),[16]Three Rivers PERQ(1979), and the laterXerox Star(1981).

In the early 1980s, with the advent of32-bitmicroprocessorssuch as theMotorola 68000, several new competitors appeared, includingApollo ComputerandSun Microsystems,[17]with workstations based on 68000 andUnix.[18][19]Meanwhile,DARPA'sVLSI Projectcreated several spinoff graphics products, such as theSilicon Graphics3130. Target markets were differentiated, with Sun and Apollo considered to be network workstations and SGI as graphics workstations.RISCCPUs increased in the mid-1980s, typical of workstation vendors.[20]Competition between RISC vendors lowered CPU prices to as little as $10 per MIPS, much less expensive than theIntel 80386;[21]after large price cuts in 1987 and 1988, a personal workstation suitable for 2D CAD costing$5,000(equivalent to $13,000 in 2024) to$25,000(equivalent to $63,000 in 2024) was available from multiple vendors. Mid-range models capable of 3D graphics cost from$35,000(equivalent to $89,000 in 2024) to$60,000(equivalent to $152,000 in 2024), while high-end models overlapping with minicomputers cost from$80,000(equivalent to $203,000 in 2024) to$100,000(equivalent to $254,000 in 2024) or more.[22]

InfoWorldin 1989 described Sun as "the unquestioned leader in the workstation arena". It and other RISC workstation vendors likeHewlett-Packardwere very successful in luring customers from traditional minicomputer companies like DEC andData Generalwith more performance per dollar, forcing them to release their own workstations that year.[23]By then a$12,000(equivalent to $30,000 in 2024) "personal workstation" might be a high-end PC likeMacintosh IIorIBM PS/2 Model 80, low-end workstation, or a hybrid device like theNeXT Computer, all with similar, overlapping specifications.[8]One differentiator between PC and workstation was that the latter was much more likely to have agraphics acceleratorwith support for a graphics standard likePHIGSorX Window, while the former usually depended onsoftware renderingor proprietary accelerators. Thecomputer animationindustry's needs typically caused improvements in graphical technology, with CAD using the same improvements later.[22]BYTEpredicted in 1989 "Soon, the only way we'll be able to tell the difference between traditional workstations and PCs will be by the operating system they run", with the former running Unix and the latter runningOS/2,classic Mac OS, and/or Unix. Many workstations by then had some method to run increasingly popular and powerful PC software such asLotus 1-2-3orMicrosoft Word.[8]The magazine demonstrated that year that an individual could build a workstation with commodity components with specifications comparable to commercially available low-end workstations.[24]

By 1990, when IBM announcedRS/6000, workstations were the fastest-growing segment of the PC market.[25]Competition decreased prices so quickly thatGartner Groupthat year adviseddepreciationfor Unix RISC systems of 45% or more annually, twice the normal rate.[26]Workstations often featuredSCSIorFibre Channeldisk storage systems, high-end3D accelerators, single or multiple64-bitprocessors,[27]large amounts ofRAM, and well-designed cooling.  Additionally, the companies that make the products tend to have comprehensive repair/replacement plans.  As the distinction between workstation and PC fades, however, workstation manufacturers have increasingly employed "off-the-shelf" PC components and graphics solutions rather than proprietary hardware or software. Some "low-cost" workstations are still expensive by PC standards but offer binary compatibility with higher-end workstations and servers made by the same vendor. This allows software development to take place on low-cost (relative to the server) desktop machines.

Workstations diversified to the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance, called thethin clientornetwork computer. Dependent upon a network and server, this reduces the machine to having no hard drive, and only the CPU, keyboard, mouse, and screen.  Somediskless nodesstill run a traditional operating system and perform computations locally, with storage on a remoteserver.[28]These are intended to reduce the initial system purchase cost, and thetotal cost of ownership, by reducing the amount of administration required per user.[29]

This approach was first attempted as a replacement for PCs in office productivity applications, with the3Stationby3Com. In the 1990s,X terminalsfilled a similar role for technical computing. Sun'sthin clientsinclude theSun Rayproduct line.[30]However, traditional workstations and PCs continued to drop in price and complexity as remote management tools for IT staff became available, undercutting this market.

A high-end workstation of the early 1980s with the three Ms, or a "3M computer" (coined by Raj Reddy and his colleagues at CMU), has one megabyte of RAM, a megapixel display (roughly 1000×1000 pixels), and one "MegaFLOPS" compute performance (at least one million floating-point operations per second).[31]RFC 782 defines the workstation environment more generally as "hardware and software dedicated to serve a single user", and that it provisions additional shared resources. This is at least one order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time. The original 1981IBM Personal Computerhas 16 KB memory, a text-only display, and floating-point performance around1kFLOPS(30 kFLOPSwith the optional 8087 math coprocessor). Other features beyond the typical personal computer include networking, graphics acceleration, and high-speed internal and peripheral data buses.

Another goal was to bring the price below one "megapenny", that is, less than$10,000(equivalent to $29,000 in 2024), which was achieved in the late 1980s. Throughout the early to mid-1990s, many workstations cost from$15,000to$100,000(equivalent to $206,000 in 2024) or more.

The more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream PCs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment:[32]

Since the late 1990s, the workstation and consumer markets have further merged. Many low-end workstation components are now the same as the consumer market, and the price differential narrowed. For example, mostMacintosh Quadracomputers were originally intended for scientific or design work, all with theMotorola 68040CPU, backward compatible with68000Macintoshes. The consumerMacintosh IIcxandMacintosh IIcimodels can be upgraded to theQuadra 700. "In an era when many professionals preferred Silicon Graphics workstations, the Quadra 700 was an intriguing option at a fraction of the cost" as resource-intensive software such asInfini-Dbrought "studio-quality 3D rendering and animations to the home desktop". The Quadra 700 can runA/UX3.0, making it aUnixworkstation.[34]Another example is theNvidiaGeForce 256consumer graphics card, which spawned theQuadroworkstation card, which has the same GPU but different driver support and certifications for CAD applications and a much higher price.

Workstations have typically driven advancements in CPU technology. All computers benefit from multi-processor and multicore designs (essentially, multiple processors on adie). The multicore design was pioneered by IBM'sPOWER4; it and Intel Xeon have multiple CPUs, more on-die cache, and ECC memory.

Some workstations are designed or certified for use with only one specific application such asAutoCAD,AvidXpress Studio HD, or3D Studio Max. The certification process increases workstation prices.

Modern workstations are typicallydesktop computerswithAMDorNVIDIA GPUsto dohigh-performance computingon software programs such asvideo editing,3D modeling,computer-aided design, andrendering.[35]

Title: Are ppl actually buying DDR5 now?

Post: I get that ballers dont care and will pay used corolla prices for a gpu, but im talking about everyday normal working class peeps.

Are those people actually buying ddr5 at these prices?

Or are they just opting for the cheapest kit with low MT/high CL they can find vs a 32gb kit they wanted

I know 32gb kits in Australia on avg are $399 AUD and up.

A 32 gb kit and just a budget aio = used PS5 here.

I see the peeps holding DDR4 trying to push that higher too....

Title: Asus still safe for x3d?

Post: Hey guys I have a brand new ASUS Tuff gaming b850m-e mobo to pair with a 7800x3d. 

I know asrock has been recommended against and recently heard about JayzTwoCents banning Asus from future reviews, which led me to see some people also saying some asus boards will fry an x3d. 

Is this mobo safe, or should I buy a Gigabyte/MSI board for my build and use the Asus for another build I’m doing.

Title: I think vacuuming the room just killed my PSU..?

Post: Today I converted my old iBuyPower prebuild into a linux machine running bazzite and booting straight into steam big picture mode. Suffice to say the steam machine had me inspired.

I was super excited to test it out on the tv! Ordered a rolling cart for it, but put it on the floor for the day, just to get things set up. Huge mistake..

A few hours later I was playing a youtube video on the tv through the PC and decided to do some cleaning. I ran a CORDLESS vaccuum (read: it was not plugged into the wall) over the carpeted area to pick up cat hair and shortly after, I hear horrifying screeching noises from my television - youtube video was paused, so I'm not sure if the screen had frozen, but I could still see it. I panicked, held down the power button to turn off the pc, and the sound stopped.

When I hit the power button, it tries to start - fans spin, etc - but fails, stops, and then tries and fails again, in a loop. I bought a new PSU with more wattage than minimum needed from Corsair, gonna try to swap it in tomorrow with a friend who builds computers.

Given the timing of it, it would be REALLY strange if it were anything other than the static electricity from the vacuum (??) that did this to my pc. I'm just not sure what else could have happened. I'm already trying to fix it, but I'm just crashing out over how weird of a situation this is and wanted to make a post. I'll definitely never leave a pc on the floor again.

PC was plugged into a power strip, and using a high quality hdmi cable.

Has this ever happened to anyone? Could it have been something else?

**EDIT:**

2h later Update: After the comments about RAM, I realized that the video on youtube had been SUPER choppy and that was why I had paused it, and steam games had been downloading, so with the sounds it made, a memory issue seems likely. Especially because I had picked up the tower and moved it around several times in the last few days - I tried to be gentle but it could have jostled the ram.

RAM sticks were in 1 and 3. I removed and re-seated the RAM with no change - short 1-2 sec power on before fail. But when I removed the stick in slot 1 and tried to power it on with just the stick in slot 3, it stayed on for much longer, the fan LEDs came on and switched between my saved color and the default rgb animation, and it stayed on for about 20 seconds, without sending a signal to a non-smart monitor I had plugged in for troubleshooting. I attempted to get an hdmi signal from my motherboard and my graphics card.

After about 20 seconds, it "failed" again and restart, so it's still looping.

I guess I'm going to buy some RAM and see what happens when I install a new set, but given that this PC is old and this was just a side project while I wait for the release of the Steam Machine, I don't want to invest too much into this. I'm just bummed my PC isn't working now... Luckily I moved all of my files off of it yesterday to prep for the linux install.

Title: Purchased open box 5070ti received 5080?

Post: So just like the tittle says I ordered an open box 5070ti for $717.00 it a aero gigabyte card but the serial number on the card is a 5080 serial number on the PCIE, specifically GV-N5080AERO OC-16GD REV 1. What is throwing me off is the cooler, the cooler is a 3 slot design I thought the 5080 aero is a 2 slot design. Do you guys know if this card even exists? I can’t find anything online it’s weird because the cooler looks exactly like a 5070ti cooler. I’m waiting on a power supply motherboard and cpu to arrive so I can’t plug in the card to confirm. But any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Title: DDR4 vs DDR5. Is it worth to overpay now?

Post: At the moment i have 32 GB DDR4 3600 cl16.  
I would like to switch to DDR5, but because of this, I will also have to replace the motherboard, and the processor too.

How big will the difference in performance (gaming) be between DDR4 and DDR5 on the same system (cpu+gpu)?

\*\*Important note: I don't mind replacing the cpu and motherboard, but in our current situation, RAM costs more than the CPU, and this concerns me.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\*\*Update:

for now, i have 12400f and 3060 12gb  
i'd go for ryzen 7700 and 5070/5070 s/5070 ti/5070 ti s/9070/9070 xt with brand new mobo and ram  
or stay with my mobo and ram, and just swap cpu to 14600kf and some graphics card from the list above  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\*\*Update2:  
I mean something similar to this question: "How much will the performance differ between the 14600k with ddr4 (that I have now) and the 14600k with ddr5 6000 cl30?"

Title: Should I buy a GPU now and rest later?

Post: When I look at games I play my current GPU is the bottleneck. 

It's a GTX 1650 Super 4GB.  

I have an Intel i7-8700 3.2ghz on a H310M Motherboard.  

Would it be fine to buy a Radeon RX 9070 16GB GPU right now (and also upgrade my PSU) to upgrade the rest at a later moment? I'm aware the CPU will likely just be the next bottleneck.

Title: Considering moving from consoles to PC, please give me your advice and/or share your experiences, thanks!

Post: Hi guys,
I’ve been a console player my whole life, Xbox initially then moved over to PS as I got older. Currently my daily driver is still the PS4, but she’s beginning to show her age performance wise and there are a few new games I want to play that are next gen only (Ghost of Yotei I’m looking at you).
So I’ve been looking at upgrading to the PS5, but all the hype I’ve seen around the new Steam Machine has gotten me super curious about PC gaming to say the least.
I’ve done a moderate amount of research at this point so I feel like I get the jist of what moving to a PC will entail (like waiting for Ghost of Yotei to drop :( ). But I  have two major concerns:

Firstly I don’t have the room or the funding to make a full PC set up with monitors and all that, so I’m going to want to connect it to my TV, I get the disadvantages this comes with but will it make my life difficult? I don’t want to come home from a long day and have to spend 10, 15, maybe 30 minutes playing with settings before I can play my game.

Secondly &amp; similarly, I am not too interested in a keyboard and mouse set up, (again although I understand the advantages) it seems so clunky to me and if I’m playing from the couch I have no room for it. Will this make a big difference to the number of games I can play? How well a game plays? Is it complicated to set a game up to play with controller?

So I suppose I am after all the perks of console gaming; ease, accessibility and comfort but want the perks of PC gaming, is this possible?

On top of all this, any and all advice or personal experience that you can share to ease my anxiety would be well appreciated. Both the next gen consoles and PC set ups are not cheap and I’m not the richest person in the world so I want to be confident I’m making the right decision before doing so.

Thanks in advance!

TLDR: Wanting to move from console to PC, can I play from the couch easily, will all games be playable with a controller, and will it be overly time consuming adjusting settings? Any and all advice for a PC newbie is appreciated, thanks!

Title: Should I bite the bullet and go to AM5 or stay at AM4

Post: The title says it all. I’m currently rocking a ryzen 5600, 32gb DDR4 3200mhz, and a rx 6700xt. I wanna upgrade the GPU to like a 9060xt but was wondering if it would be best to also bite the bullet and upgrade to AM5? I feel like with ram prices what they are that I should just upgrade the GPU and wait until the settle out or go down. I’m just worried about using the 9060xt with my b459m on PCIe 3.0 or will I see much of a difference? I game on a 1080p 165hz monitor and don’t see me changing that anytime soon.

Title: Is the XFX Mercury 9070xt OC worth 800$?

Post: Can't seem to find a better deal anywhere, I'm looking for either a 9070xt or 5070 ti, I also found a PNY 5070 ti oc for an extra 135$ but idk if it's worth the difference

Title: GPU Dilemma: PNY Dual Fan ($579 CAD) vs. ASUS Prime Triple Fan ($626 CAD)?

Post: Building a new 1440p gaming PC and these are the last two options for the essential RTX 5060 Ti 16GB.

• Option A (Cheapest): PNY RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Dual Fan OC at $579.99 CAD

• Option B (Quieter): ASUS Prime RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Triple Fan at $626.00 CAD


That's a difference of $46
My Main Question: I'm planning on keeping this GPU for a long time. Is the $46  premium for the ASUS Prime worth it for the better, quieter triple-fan cooler and better build quality 

The PNY is a great price, but I'm worried about noise/longevity compared to the ASUS's more robust cooling system over the long run.
Thanks for any help!

Title: Is custom still more cost-effective?

Post: After 8 years, I'm finally in a position to replace my old custom build. Back in the day, it seemed pretty common that it was significantly cheaper to order individual parts and build the entire PC yourself than buy a pre-built. But with the high mark-ups and low stock on GPUs these days in particular, it's starting to look like I can find a better deal on getting a prebuilt on sale, even if I need to replace some smaller parts.

Is custom still the best value? Have I just not been vigilant enough to find a respectable sale price for a 5090? Or is my best bet just going to be going with a prebuilt and upgrading individual parts these days?

Title: Looking for Headset advice!

Post: I'm currently in the market for a headset and I want to take advantage of the sales currently, but most are either insanely overpriced in my opinion or they're all wireless. Could I get any recommendations for a good wired headset? My old Corsair Void Elite wired headset's sound is starting to go out so I need a replacement. Any advice is welcomed.

Title: RFC - PC Build for Windows

Post: Hey all, I've decided to build a PC. I haven't ordered any parts yet and still deciding what to buy. Here are the parts: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/MtFQt3](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/MtFQt3) 

First time building a PC, have always used laptops my entire life. Ideally I want specs that are *slightly* overkill for these use cases, instead of being 'just nice' (to give myself some safety margin and to make upgrading easier):

* Mainly gonna be using it for programming (VSCode and IntelliJ on WSL)
* It'll be a Win11 PC. For Linux use cases, I'll need to run linux VM for some tasks
* Will play some less intensive games like League of Legends.

Please give me some feedback!

Title: 9800X3D and 5080 Build Feedback for CPU Heavy Gaming

Post: I would appreciate any thoughts or input you all might have on my build.

I mostly play grand strategy games, Victoria 3, EU5 type stuff, with some Captain of Industry,  and sometimes shooters like BF6. So I think good CPU performance is probably the most critical thing.

I am planning on buying a 5k2k monitor. I thought the 5080 might be worth it over the 5070TI for \~$250. A 5090 is too rich unfortunately for my tastes.

I am mainly paying with best buy gift cards I have, thus the reason for mainly choosing best buy over amazon/elsewhere, except for the parts I couldn't find exactly what I wanted at best buy.

Title: I have been looking to upgrade my CPU for my setup but the DDR5 RAM prices are making me pause.

Post: CPU: AMD Ryzen 3950x

GPU: RTX 3090

RAM: 64gb DDR4 3600 MHz

Mobo: ROG STRIX X570-e

Booting from a Sabrent Rocket 4.0


I built this almost 6 years ago now, it was my first build and at the time I was looking at using this as a hybrid workstation and gaming PC. Now I mostly use this for Gaming and was looking to upgrade my build. 

For a minute now I have been looking to move to AM5 as I have heard great things about the 9800x3d and I play at 1440p, so it seemed like a great idea. Of course now, instead of my GPU being the thing that is not available widely it is the RAM. 

Right now I am looking at a good bundle at Microcenter that would give me an X870-e and 9800x3d for $549.00 USD but the RAM if bought there is going to be at least 200 dollars for a 32gb kit.

Is it worth it? I play games like ARC Raiders and Deadlock (runs on source 2), I do some work stuff on it still too but it is not the main usage of it. I like upgrading as little as possible so if I could hold onto this CPU for many years that would make me very happy.

I have some knowledge but I thought I would get some other views and perspectives.

Thank you in advance for your time. &lt;3

Title: I accidentally dropped my 9800x3d

Post: Title. First time PC builder here and while taking the CPU out of the box I got confused on which way the plastic cover opened up and the CPU ended up dropping an inch or 2 on a granite countertop. The good news is that it landed on the IHS part and I saw no visible scratches or dents. In my rush and panic I kinda just installed it quickly and gently from there but I actually forgot to check the bottom gold plates. Am I cooked or should I be ok? Thanks

Title: Help me pick a CPU and a PC case

Post: After getting my hands on a cheap x870 Aorus Elite Wifi7 mobo I decided to build a mid-high gaming PC. Even tho I picked the most parts I am losing sleep over the CPU and the case choices.. 

For CPU: its either 7800x3d (373$) or 9800x3d (496$) Debate of the decade right…

And for the case its either Lian Li O11 Dynamic Flow mini v2 (5 fans) or Montech King 95 Pro (6 fans)

There is a deal on these specific cases, one come with 6 fans other 5 so I have to pay for an extra fan with lian li. With the extra fan included on the price of lian li, both are exactly the same price.

The build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hqxz2x
Help me decide pretty please :)

Title: PC won't boot anymore after working for 4 months

Post: Hello everyone! I have a PC build that worked perfectly for 4 months, but now it doesn’t POST at all anymore. No BIOS, no beep sound, no monitor output. The fans do turn on, and then the orange DRAM light stays on continuously.

The last thing that was done with the PC was a Windows update. The next day I booted it again, and the DRAM light came on and the PC no longer started.

I’ve searched extensively for possible fixes, but nothing has worked so far. Does anyone know anything else I could try?

**The build:**

* Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D
* Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B650E-F GAMING WIFI
* RAM: G.Skill Flare X5 F5-6000J3038F16GX2-FX5 – 32 GB: 2 × 16 GB – 288-PIN – 6000 MHz / PC5
* PSU: GIGABYTE GP-UD750GM PG5 750 Watt
* Storage: Lexar NQ790 2TB
* CPU cooling: Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE
* GPU: MSI GeForce RTX 3060 VENTUS 2X 12G

(I know the cpu is overkill for the gpu, i planned on replacing the gpu in the near future)

**What I’ve already tried:**

* Tested RAM sticks one by one in all possible configurations
* Removed CMOS battery
* BIOS flashback
* Waited a long time in case it was doing RAM training
* Removed GPU/SSD/peripherals and booted with only the basics

After that, I brought the PC to a local repair shop. They tried other parts, without results. They could not test/replace the motherboard and CPU. I’ve now replaced both the motherboard and CPU myself with identical models, but still the same result: no POST and a lit DRAM light. So even after replacing these parts and re-building the setup the PC does not boot.

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could try next, or any thoughts on what might be causing this problem? Thanks in advance!

Title: Building around current Setup (Help!)

Post: Hello all, I recently upgraded my GPU; however, the rest of my PC is severely outdated, and my CPU is being bottlenecked.

I am super out of touch with PC parts right now, as I haven't researched anything outside a GPU in several years. So help is appreciated.

I did some research and this is what I came up with:

\[PCPartPicker Part List\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Kym6Yd](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Kym6Yd))

From this list, I have the Samsung SSDs, 5070ti, and the power supply.

What do you guys think? I wouldn't mind saving some extra money if there are some discounts I missed or choosing other cheaper parts that wouldn't sacrifice too much performance.

Thanks in advance.

Title: First time building a PC. Need advice on parts list

Post: My current PC is prebuilt I got like 7 years ago with a 1070 ti and a i7-8700.

**My parts list**

* Ryzen 5 9600x
* PNY 5070 OC triple fan
* ASUS TUF B850-PLUS
* Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 AIO
* Corsair Vengeance DDR5 16GB 5200MHz
* 990 EVO Plus 1TB SSD
* Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850W 80 Plus Gold
* Montech XR-B ATX Mid-Tower

Total price with tax and shipping is **$1,377.50**

I checked on pcpartpicker and it says its fine. My questions are; is the gpu being OC good, bad or neutral? anything you would change without making it much more expensive (like more reliable brands)? A**nything else I need to buy like do I need to buy my own thermal paste?**

I know 1tb storage and 16gb ram isn't much but with ram prices and my current budget I'm settling for now

also I have already watched a million different building guides but any advice is welcome

Title: Will I need larger power supply and larger case if upgrading?  Will be upgrading this 2016 build.

Post: Bought this entire build in 2016, my lenovo laptop is giving me constant ip4 errors so if replacing the ssd doesn't work, I'm going to completely upgrade desktop.  Bought all of this in 2016..When i briefly looked at what I needed to upgrade, it seemed that I inevitably needed a larger power supply for really any larger graphics card I choose to get, and thus would possibly need a larger case..since I also plan on upgrading motherboard, I seem to need to upgrade basically everything.  



Am I going to need a larger case to house a larger power supply for basically any modern day graphics card?

Title: BIOS boot times increased with memory context restore and memory power down enabled

Post: On my msi x670e wifi, I enabled both memory context restore and memory power down, thinking it would improve my boot times. It didn't. I'm getting 25-30 second boot times when before I got 10-15 seconds. The only thing I changed was these two settings which were on auto before.

What the hell is going on? Aren't these settings supposed to increase boot times? I've also tried with just memory context restore enabled and my boot times were still 30+ seconds...

Post: i am a Intel + Nvidia guy and i always bough that combo and was fine with overclocking and everything but since Intel is not doing so good in the recent years i went with AMD this time with a:   
Ryzen 7 9700x  
MSI B650 Tomahawk  
990PRO 1tb  
My old GPU which still holds up really well RTX 2080TI  
and 32gb 2x16gb 6000mt cl38  
but apparently the ram does not support AMD overclocking profile (EXPO?) and I'm getting random restarts when i enable the overclocking profile for 6000mt  
is it not possible for me to use my ram at its advertised speed just because its AMD this time?  
now I'm using them at 4800mt which is a real bummer but at the very least its stable  
i really do hope Intel does a strong comeback!

Title: 7800x3d or 9800x3d?

Post: Looking to upgrade with Black Friday deals coming up, just really can’t decided between 7800x3d or 9800x3d. I’m running 5070ti with ddr5 cl30 6000mhz ram on 1440p oled monitor. Black Friday deals at microcenter seem like the move right now with saving money for a good build. Just want to know if it’s worth going with a 9800x3d over 7800x3d if there’s really a significant difference 1440p gaming overall or if it’ll pretty much be around close to each other in performance and really won’t be missing out on much.

Title: Should I upgrade or save for a new build? Goal: 4K Gaming

Post: Hey everyone,

  
I’m currently debating whether to slowly upgrade my existing PC or save up and build an entirely new system. My end goal is **comfortable 4K gaming** (high settings, stable performance). I’m a bit unsure whether my current platform is worth upgrading, or if it’s better to start fresh.

Here are my current components:

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-11600K 
* **Motherboard:**  B560 Pro4
* **GPU:** RTX 3060 12GB
* **RAM:**16 GB DDR4 3600
* **PSU:** 750W

If I should upgrade, what would you recommend as the first steps?

Thanks in advanced.

Title: Advice To Become A PC Hardware Assembler/ Technician

Post: I tried to search under this reddit group for previous posts in regards to my title and I couldn't find one that's recent.

My sister is looking to go to college, and has mentioned how much she loves putting computers together.  
I used to do side gigs building custom PCs over 10 years ago, and some software services. She has NO interest in anything to do with software. Simply hardware building computers. 

Would there be specific certificates or degrees she would need? Or what kind of jobs/careers titles to look for?



Thanks!!

Title: CPU bottlenecking question

Post: I recently upgraded my GPU and am trying to maximize my FPS in games like CS2 and Valorant. However, I seem to only get like 140FPS and 200FPS, respectively. After doing some research, I started to check my CPU/GPU usage rates.

For the most part, my CPU usage rate while playing is in the 40-50% range, while my GPU is in the 20% range. Is my CPU bottlenecking my GPU or is this normal?

Currently, I have an i7-8700k and a 5070ti.

Title: Sell or Use this Old, Unused Gaming PC?

Post: Ok so let go back in time to 2015.

I built this Gaming PC which was pretty decent at the time. Im at work and the PC is at home so Im unsure of the particulars but: 

CPU: Intel i5-4690k
GPU: EVGA GTX 1080
Mobo: MSI Z97 Gaming 5
RAM: 16gb Corsair Vengeance
HD: 1tb WD Black 10,000rpm + 240gb SSD (forgot the brand)
Heatsink: Corsair H100i (or 110i?)
Case: Corsair Obsidian 900D
PSU: Corsair 1000w PSU
(Yea i was a corsair fanboy)

I built the PC (but didnt install the GPU, will explain below) in 2015 but here is the thing. 
I have never turned it on. I have never used it.

In fact my GPU is still in its box, in pristine, brand new condition. My thinking was I'll install the GPU when Im sure I have time to turn it on and install the OS and update everything.

Life happened. Kids etc. 10 years later, that PC is still sitting in the room, built, but havent tasted a lick of electricity.

My question is, is it worth it to open and install the GPU and use this PC OR should I just sell the pc parts and build/buy a modern one?
Is this PC still going to be ok for gaming?
My pc monitor is a 1080p so I dont see myself playing in 1440p or 4k.

What do you guys think? 
I'll attach photos later when I get home. 
Thanks!

Edit: As promised, here are the pictures
https://imgur.com/a/w75LECV

A couple corrections, I guess I remembered wrong:
The GPU is Asus. Unopened of course.
The PSU is only 850, not 1000w
Film is still on but its dusty as hell. 
I didnt take out the heatsink to show you the cpu. Too much work.

Title: High End Home Theatre PC LF Suggestions

Post: Hi. This is my first time building a PC, let alone a home theater one. That said, I want to make one that I can upgrade over time as needed and be able to use as a PC for my living room without it looking like an RGB circus. I partially blame the recent Steam Machine announcement for pushing me into this direction.

That said, below is the list I had came up with so far. If you got any suggestions, let me know if it looks solid or not. I want to think that cooling may be an issue, but I plan to have it out in the open instead of it being in a cabinet.

Title: Do I REALLY have to get a new power supply?

Post: Today, while I was attempting to build my PC, I came to the unfortunate discovery that my GPU (Nvidia MSI 4070 Ti Super) and my power supply (EVGA SuperNOVA 1000W GT) might be incompatible because my GPU has a 12 pin connection whereas my PSU doesn't have a 12 pin connector (or an adapter). I'm trying to find a 12 pin to 6 pin connector, &amp; maybe I can't find any due to this discovery making me a SPECIAL type of upset but I swear that I CANNOT find anyone that sells those...I can't even seem to find an adapter. Please help, I've already spent so much money on this thing &amp; it's way too late to return the PSU for a refund 😭.

Post: So after a couple of years of sitting in the Work shed, they decided to chuck out some old touchscreen computers that people used to place their photo orders on and come back later and pick them up.

I have no real need for it, but I would like to do something with it
My first thought was is there any way I can make it like the arcade one game table?

My second thought is maybe the smart people of the Internet would have an idea on what I could do with it?

Title: Dustproof and waterproof PC case (IP54)

Post: Hello, I have a somewhat unusual project in mind.

I have a small chicken coop. It is somewhat insulated, but when the temperature outside drops below freezing, the temperature inside falls to 0 degrees, which is too cold for me. I would like to keep the coop at 3-7 degrees. To do this, I have an infrared heater, but it also draws around 50-70W.



I have a home lab with several computers in my basement. One of them is intended for video recognition (foxes, etc.) and runs on Frigate. It currently runs at around 30-40W, but I could increase this to 50-70W with slightly higher video rates.



The chicken coop has both power and (theoretically, not now but easy to manage) LAN connection.

Now my idea is, why generate heat energy twice? Why not use the waste heat from the computer to heat the coop?

In principle, an aluminum cube is sufficient as a PC case. However, it must be dustproof and splash-proof (IP 54).



I have considered using cable garden boxes like these. But plastic is a poor heat conductor. Why not an aluminum case?

However, I can't find a good aluminum case. Now I've considered putting the PC in a slightly larger aluminum box (like a toolbox), drilling two holes for power and LAN, and then sealing them with rubber plugs (like on power cable distribution boxes).



Have you seen an inexpensive IP54 case in mATX or, if necessary, ITX format anywhere?

Title: CPU Upgrade without replacing my AM4 motherboard

Post: My current PC is a 2700x on a Asus TUF B450-Plus Gaming with 64 GB of RAM and a 4070 TI Super and the CPU is starting to cause me issues.

I use the PC both for gaming and SQL/Data Analytics productivity work.

I'd rather avoid replacing the motherboard at this point as thats a whole lot of work so I was looking at the 5800XT and 5900XT as they appear to be the best options based on this compatibility list?

www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-b450-plus-gaming/helpdesk_cpu?model2Name=TUF-B450-PLUS-GAMING

Is there a better option I should be looking at and is the extra cost of the 5900XT worth it for my use cases?

Title: Horrible experience with the Lexar 4TB NM1090 PRO with cloning drive

Post: I have no idea if the NVME SSD was DOA or just my fault but I tried for the last 6 hours trying to clone my OS onto it from my SN850X 2TB with no luck. Got a pretty good deal from it too from Adorama.

I first installed it and it worked fine, being recognized in the system in my file directory after I partitioned it with the default settings that Windows provided. I ran a quick Crystal Diskmark benchmark to see if it registered at its high speed for a gen5 drive. No issues yet until I went on Macrium Reflect on its free trial (due to its advertised ease of use despite it being a paid subscription software). Right after that everything went downhill when it disappeared from my file directory and gave me Error 8 and wouldn't let me shut down properly (Monitors turn off but PC remains on) unless I held down the power button.

I tried using other software like from EaseUS but their software didn't let me continue without purchasing their license when I was trying to run it.

I used Lexar's SSD Wizard, which for some odd reason only works with other Lexar SSD's and said the Drive's health was Good. I also used it to see if the Firmware was up-to-date, which it was.

And last but not least I used Disk Genius, which seemed the best out of these 4 by giving me an actual error saying it had bad read sectors. 

I tried

Title: Are these components fine?

Post: I had a pre-owned PC that I wanted to upgrade, but then realized the motherboard was quite outdated so I just decided to build a whole new one. This is the link to what I'm planning to build, but I just wanted to see if these components are good together or if there's better alternatives for around the same price, or if there's anything else I need to add. I'm not that knowledgeable about PC building so my choices might be odd.

I'm mostly using this PC to play FPS games and program.

Title: Cl 38 vs Cl 30 9600x

Post: Hi, everyone

I’ve recently built my first pc ever. I did a lot of research and I feel that I ended up with a great build: CPU- 9600x / GPU- 9060xt (16gb)/ Motherboard B850 Auros Elite Ice/ RAM- Tforce Vulcan 32gb @6000mhz Cl38

One thing that went over my head when picking out parts was RAM latency. Will Cl 30 be better for this build or am I thinking too much about it? I do have the option of getting a Cl 30 pair for pretty cheap compared to prices right now. I am asking for input before I commit on a purchase. Thank you!

Title: Case XPG BATTLECRUISER could have problems with wider Gpus?

Post: I have an XPG BATTLECRUISER v1 case, which has been on the market for about five years. Its specifications say it supports GPUs up to almost 15 inches long, but I see a problem with the width. I have an RTX 3080 TUF Gaming, which is 4.7 inches wide, and its power cables are almost touching the side panel of the case. This makes me think that if I use a GPU that's 5.5 inches or slightly wider, I won't be able to close the door.

Title: GPU Pulls 163W and Shuts Down PC in One Game Only — PSU Issue or Faulty RX 7600?

Post: Ryzen 5 5600g CPU
2x8 Gb XPG Ram
600 W bronze PSu
Brand New XFX RX 7600 GPU

Hello,

After using my computer for a long time with the Ryzen 5 5600G’s integrated Vega GPU, I finally decided to buy a dedicated graphics card. I chose the XFX RX 7600 as a price-performance option.

The card had a very disturbing coil whine problem. After testing it for a bit, I sent it in for a replacement request, but the authorized service rejected my return/replacement claim. They stated that coil whine is not considered a hardware defect by the manufacturer (XFX) and sent the card back to me.

While testing the card for coil whine, I didn’t encounter any other issues, but I also didn’t test it for long sessions at that time. After the card was returned to me, I tried it with my newer games to see if there were any additional problems. Everything seemed fine, and I was getting used to the coil whine—until my PC suddenly shut down while playing Spider-Man Miles Morales. It wasn’t a restart or BSOD; it simply turned off completely. I powered it back on manually.

I initially thought it might be a coincidence or a power fluctuation, so I tried playing the game again. The exact same shutdown happened—no errors, no restart, just a complete power-off.

When the GPU usage reached 100%, I saw the card pulling 163W in this game. It behaves similarly in other games as well (The Last of Us, Dying Light: The Beast, Ghost of Tsushima—all draw around 163W at 100% load). Disabling Frame Generation reduces power consumption by around 20–40W.

Without Frame Generation and with FPS capped at 60, I played for about 1.5 hours without any issues. In this mode, the GPU only consumed around 45–80W.

My question is: Is it normal for Frame Generation to increase power consumption this much, or is there something wrong with the card? The sudden shutdowns scared me at first because I never experienced anything like this when using the Ryzen 5 5600G’s integrated GPU. The fact that a brand-new GPU has coil whine already hurt my confidence, and I worried that it might have been damaged during shipping or handling at the service center.

When I asked ChatGPT about this issue, it suggested a possible PSU or cable problem. But since the shutdown only happened in Spider-Man Miles Morales with Frame Generation enabled and no FPS cap, I’m not fully convinced. I played The Last of Us for 1.5–2 hours at full settings and with Frame Generation enabled, and there were no shutdowns. If the PSU were the issue, I think The Last of Us would have caused a shutdown too.

I also found a YouTube benchmark using the same GPU, and in the video the card also draws around 163W at full load. This made me think the PSU might not be the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvc9FI1WEmI

So, what could be the exact cause of this problem? PC parts are expensive where I live, and I don’t have the luxury of swapping components just to test things, so I need an accurate diagnosis.

Title: Is this a good PC build?

Post: I'll be building a PC in January for both Gaming for 1440p and 3D work, and I just want to ask if this is a good build? 

I know some of these parts are overkill for gaming, but as I stated I do 3D work involving multiple 3D applications and rendering, which is why I am going for overkill.

I've already bought RAM as the prices are skyrocketing for it, so I bought it in case it increases even more before January. I just can't buy all the parts yet as I don't get all my money till January (I **can** buy the SSD if that keeps increasing in price before January)

I'll list a link to all the parts, as they are all on my amazon basket.

As of right now, the entire PC all together would cost £3203.62 ($4,190.17) which also includes the RAM I bought. Just to let you know, I am not including the monitor or anything else for this budget, just the PC parts and case, as everything else is a different budget.



The entire budget for the PC is £3500 ($4,577.83) but it can be increased to £3700-3800 ($4,839.42-$4,970.21) if the prices do increase for anything.



Just to note, I was going to pick an RTX 5070 TI but as of right now, the 5080 is only 130 more which is why I have picked it currently.

Title: Is the jump to 1440p worth the loss in frames?

Post: I have a pretty good 24in 1080p 165hz IPS BenQ monitor and I use a laptop with a 3060 so I've almost always played on low-medium settings regardless of the game I play. I'm building a PC this holidays and I'm planning on building a RX 9070XT/9800X3D combo. 

Everyone says that's a 1440p card but I have two things in my mind. First, I've always played low quality on 1080p so I feel like being able to play ultra on 1080p with a lot of frames would be amazing. Second, I'm worried that jumping to 1440p will make my frames drop too much. Looking at reviews, having max settings gets you anywhere from 50-100 frames at 1440p but I'm sure that if you did it on 1080p, you'd get a lot more frames.

So, do you guys think it's worth it for me to get a 1440p monitor and make the jump?

Title: Looking to upgrade my pc from 5600X to AM5

Post: So I am currently using a 5600X with a RTX5070 Ti. I am playing BF6, and I am heavily CPU bound and can't get near my monitors 144 fps in big game modes.

I am thinking of upgrading to the 7800X3D or the 9800X3D, but it seems I picked the worst time to upgrade with the RAM prices going up due to AI bubble.

Looking around the Black Friday deals I found:

[https://www.canadacomputers.com/en/amd-desktop-processors/267277/amd-r7-7800x3d-cpu-gigabyte-b650-eagle-ax-motherboard-t-force-32gb-d5-6000mhz-cl30-ram.html](https://www.canadacomputers.com/en/amd-desktop-processors/267277/amd-r7-7800x3d-cpu-gigabyte-b650-eagle-ax-motherboard-t-force-32gb-d5-6000mhz-cl30-ram.html)

A 7800X3D + B650 mobo + 32gb ram for $850 CAD. All looks good except the mobo, which isn't bad but isn't great. Looking at each individual price, it's 640 for the cpu, 200 for the mobo and 300 for ram.

My other option is:

[https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-8-core-5-2ghz-am5-processor-with-msi-x870-wifi7-atx-am5-ddr5-motherboard/B0019002](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-8-core-5-2ghz-am5-processor-with-msi-x870-wifi7-atx-am5-ddr5-motherboard/B0019002)

A 9800X3D with MSI X870 Tomahawk mobo for $980, then i'd buy ram separately which I found for 32 GB 6000mhz 30CL for $300. There is some slightly varying bundles with the cpu and mobo, where I could cut down some cost. Individual parts cost 600 for cpu, 335 for mobo, 300 for ram. 

So what should I do? I do want to keep the option to upgrade to Zen 6 in the future if possible. Unless it's not worth it and wait for the next full upgrade.

Title: which graphics card is the right one for me?

Post: I am starting the process of putting together the list of parts for my PC. It is my first time going through this process. My budget is up to 2k and I live in the US. 

  
I mostly play open world type, single player games (i.e. skyrim, cyberpunk etc.) and want to be able to mod them however I want without having to worry about the PC keeping up. I am also interested in giving some online multiplayer games a try but, correct me if im wrong, I feel like if my PC can handle the games mentioned earlier with full mods I should be ok on that front.

I am going to invest in a nice monitor but that is not included in my budget at all. Based on the above which graphic card do you think would be best for me?

Title: PC for linux gaming

Post: Hi!

I'm planning to build a PC on linux. Tired of windows, and hoping to take advantage of what steam are doing. There are some pretty good ditributions already and maybe Steam OS will expand in the future too.

From what I hear AMD is kind of mandatory here, as it's much better supported than Nvidia. My last build was Nvidia though about 3 years ago, when I decided playing around with AI and having some edge on upscale (which i barely use) and raytracing stuff (which i've used but let's be honest that's not the majority) was worth the premium. I went 4080 back then.

I know it's early to upgrade but my wife is also in need of an upgrade so she would be happy to receive this machine which still works well.

My way of thinking is I usually want no compromise on performance, and my budget usually brings me to the "almost top" - 4080 but not 4090, I7 but not I9. Not optimal perf to price but hey, that's how it is.

I also know I'm gonna have to sell a few of my organs for ram :D

The real question is, how is AMD GPU gaming these days? Any experience on Linux? And is the less supported gimmicks like RT and up scaling something you've regretted? Is there an AMD GPU that would be better than my 4080 in a significant way? It feels like GPUs haven't improved all that much in the last 4 years. Also, this build project could wait a few month if there is an AMD release around the corner.

Note: I also don't play any multiplayer game with anti cheat so I'm pretty confident I can avoid the usual issue with Linux gaming. And my time playing around with AI locally has come to an end.

Title: ram compatibility and increased capacity

Post: Hello,

I have a computer with an

MSI Pro B660A DDR4, an i5 12400F processor, and 16GB of RAM. 

I want to upgrade to 32GB of RAM, but when I inserted the RAM into slots 2 and 4 on the right, the computer only boots at 2133MHz and doesn't boot at 3200MHz. My question is, if I add 4 more RAM modules, will it boot at 3200MHz or 2133MHz

And if I use RAM modules from different manufacturers but with the same speed and timing, will it work , thank you.

Title: Help deciding whether to upgrade from a 4080 super to a 5090

Post: So I only bought my 4080 super rig last year for £1800, but starting to worry that going forward 16GB VRAM won’t be enough for high/ultra settings on future titles at 1440p.

I was wondering whether a 5090 rig at £3800 is a better investment, since it has twice the VRAM, and sell my current rig for around £1000.

Title: So, what am I getting into here?

Post: I've been considering a new computer because I just found out my gaming laptop is most likely dead for good. (tldr I spilled a drink on it and was too broke to get it fixed until it was way too late). So, I'm devastated, and of course I immediately start thinking about trying to start saving for a new computer. But then I decided I wanted to change from a laptop to desktop, because I'm tired of trying to get an ideal build that's decently future proof and not an absolute fortune. Plus I'm pretty sure I got ripped off pretty badly by not doing enough research on the actual components and got blinded by the "ooh shiny gaming computer on sale!" 

So now I'm looking into desktops, and I get struck by a sudden inspiration. *What if I could save money and get more of what I actually want in a computer by building my own?* So I grilled my computer scientist friend on what to look for in a gaming computer and clarify all my spots of confusion, and start looking at parts on Amazon. Oh boy am I in way over my head already. It's VERY intimidating, but I'm trying to be brave. And then I look up what a good graphics card is that isn't Nvidia. ***Jesus christ on a crackerjack that's expensive!*** 

So I look at a post from 2 years ago on this very subreddit, and it's kinda helpful actually about how much a decent game pc costs to build. But how do I know that's actually accurate to today's prices? So I decided to ask a new question to get the most up to date answers. 

Basically, how much is it going to cost to get a decent game pc built? What price range am I looking at? 

Here's some info to help you answer that question. I like my fancy graphics, but I don't necessarily need 4k. I like a higher FPS but I don't need the absolute fastest of the fast, 60 or 90 does fine for me. I've got a mouse, keyboard, chair, desk, but not a monitor. Some of the games I play are GTAV (I don't know if I'll be getting 6), Minecraft sometimes with heavy modding, subnautica, warframe, the forest, 7 days to die, Sims 4, and my unfortunate true love Genshin Impact. (Listen they make really pretty environments!) I usually grab a friend or two and play with them, but I'm less into the "lots of people in one place" kind of thing. I also plan on using this for college classes, video editing and uploading, and maybe drawing or game development in the future. I'll probably need a good bit of storage, because I am a chronic picture hoarder and back my phone up to computer to free up space. I mean I filled up 2 entire TB of storage and still had more shit to go. 

Ask me any questions and I'll answer to the best I can! Thanks in advance for helping me figure out if I should go whole hog and dive in or maybe wait until I've got a little more income and stick with a prebuilt for now.

Title: 5080 or Other Option?

Post: Hi. I am looking to swap my 3060 Ti for a 5080. Can anyone give me feedback on this build idea? I do not know much about graphics cards, and I am still in the middle of doing a bunch of research so I don't spend a bundle on something that's not actually worth it. 

  
I was thinking of purchasing this 5080 in particular:

[https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-WINDFORCE-GV-N5080GAMING-OC-16GD/dp/B0DS2R6948?crid=2MYG8CHF0LQID&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X8E3KaFCmIPpWNEny7fVYNaFT7fUZLyouCnP6iefJgaWHbdujpthwSpuIz24sqaafE0oD86TDfi0YSQKjO2YGWl-5\_5mdnfIAkNarpQ0ghYrkqnh5zqtTj\_jmHxA\_bx21qdmmWfqCvtIv3oFkgVbTLdfR7RM3qRDqy6g8EOhbSaN9itjZ0TGiJ3\_8FISY0\_RZWTXLvQwpLZmr\_H2NeOpu1jGMJrytUfKTax2S2P3ZO4.P2Sjjx3bMgbV1uX\_84gHsnCzbJ\_3jSv4C-6aI9lv1bs&amp;dib\_tag=se&amp;keywords=RTX%2B5080&amp;qid=1763780981&amp;sprefix=rtx%2B5080%2Caps%2C205&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-WINDFORCE-GV-N5080GAMING-OC-16GD/dp/B0DS2R6948?crid=2MYG8CHF0LQID&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X8E3KaFCmIPpWNEny7fVYNaFT7fUZLyouCnP6iefJgaWHbdujpthwSpuIz24sqaafE0oD86TDfi0YSQKjO2YGWl-5_5mdnfIAkNarpQ0ghYrkqnh5zqtTj_jmHxA_bx21qdmmWfqCvtIv3oFkgVbTLdfR7RM3qRDqy6g8EOhbSaN9itjZ0TGiJ3_8FISY0_RZWTXLvQwpLZmr_H2NeOpu1jGMJrytUfKTax2S2P3ZO4.P2Sjjx3bMgbV1uX_84gHsnCzbJ_3jSv4C-6aI9lv1bs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=RTX%2B5080&amp;qid=1763780981&amp;sprefix=rtx%2B5080%2Caps%2C205&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1)

I am a little miffed that it only has 16 GB of VRAM, but that's still double of what I have now, so it will likely be sufficient for what I want to do. My CPU is an AMD Ryzen 7 9700x. Thanks!

Title: Upgrade Path: 9070XT or 7600X and 9060XT 16GB

Post: Assume I have a budget of $750 or so to upgrade my *ancient* PC, with a i5-4690k and a GTX 970 at 16GB DDR3. This build has actually been marvelous, until I bought a 1440p monitor.

Option 1 (Revamp):

* 9060XT 16GB GPU
* Ryzen 7600X CPU
* Mobo + 32 GB DDR5
* **PRICE: $750**

Option 2 (Patchwork CPU Upgrade):

* 9070XT
* Ryzen 5500 CPU
* Mobo + 32GB DDR4
* **PRICE: $770**

Option 3 (Praise Haswell)

* 9070XT (**$570**) or 5070TI (**$700**)
* Keep CPU *until full revamp*

I suppose the main question is, at which balance should I address the GPU bottleneck? To future proof the GPU or address the CPU simultaneously, with best immediate returns. Any of the options introduce a CPU bottleneck, but maybe I can weather it at 1440p for some time. Which option looks sexiest to you?

Title: Hate being the family IT guy // PC with lung cancer

Post: Long time lurker first time caller here,  been building and fixing PCs as a hobby for about 30 year, yes Im old, and I was always the family IT guy to help out with the occasional virus, driver, or god forbid h/w failure.  My 35 y/o sister who lives with my mother, and her and her husband sit in their rooms all day smoking weed and playing sims and runescape.  She told me her C drive failed and computer is overheating.  She brought it in and this thing literally has lung cancer.  It is so caked with nicotine and weed penetrated dust and tar that the on board M2 SSD overheated and died and several case fans seized and the GPU fans were spinning so slow you could visible see the blades.  I hit it with compressed air and then after it would not come off 99% ipa and air.  It was like that scene in constantine where the devil pulled the lung cancer out of him.  Picture does not do it justice but my hands were actually stained and have been sticky with tar and skunk weed today.  Had to replace the SSD and power supply most of everything else I cleaned, or tried too.

Title: BF6 dared my 1660 Super to hit 100 FPS. Challenge accepted.

Post: I saw someone on YouTube running a stock GTX 1660 Super in Battlefield 6 and pulling something like an 80ish FPS average at 1080p low. And I just sat there thinking… there’s no way that’s all this card has.

So I gave myself a challenge, beat that number.

First thing I tried was bolting a giant dual tower Thermalright Assassin CPU cooler onto it. No glamour. Just home made standoffs, and bolts. Temps dropped about 10C, and clocks went up, but not enough to call it a win.

So I escalated.

I ran frozen coolant through a tiny aluminium block, grabbed the G-clamp I use to change brake pads with, crushed the block onto the GPU, and fed it from a drinks cooler.

Not exactly “proper engineering” but hey... if it works!

Under ice and using the curve editor the 1660 Super went from its usual 1900–1950 MHz boost to a sustained 2250 MHz. That worked out to roughly 14% higher clocks, and in Battlefield 6 it jumped from the low 80s to the high 90s and even pushed well over 100 FPS in several scenes. Eventually reaching 100FPS average. 

I did shunt mod it too, although I am not sure that made a bit of difference. 

So, turns out the 1660 Super actually can do better.

You just need sub zero water, a block, a bad idea, and a clamp that probably shouldn’t be anywhere near PC hardware.

Title: Actually bought a prebuilt

Post: My 5 year old son has started playing Minecraft in the last few months and gotten really into it. He has just been using my gaming  laptop for the time being but I wanted to put together a decent budget build for him as a xmas present. Didn't really feel like going the used route and ram pricing was ruining the budget no matter how I tried to work it out. Finally ended up deciding to grab a prebuilt for the first time in my life because the price was really solid for what it is. Plus, I always like having an excuse for a trip to Microcenter. 

I also grabbed a decent LG monitor that's 1080p 144hz. Once the ram pricing isn't so stupid, I'll drop another 16gb in there and this thing should rock minecraft or whatever else he wants to play for years to come.

Never thought that I would be a prebuilt buyer lol

Post: Hey, upgrading my monitor from 1080p 24” 180hz VA to 1440p 27” 200hz IPS, excited for the upgrade but just wanted to know are curved screens superior or is a flat screen gonna be just fine? 

Would love to know peoples opinions, as I know this is quite a pointless ask. 

Edit: Didn’t know this post would get so much traction, my current monitor is a curved screen and my upgrade is a flat screen, I really asked because I wanted to know if I’m gonna miss the curve or will my newer monitor be so great the curve isn’t needed, also what is ultrawide gaming? I thought everybody plays on 16:9?!

Went with be quiet! Silent Wings Pro 4s. 3x 140mm front and 1x 140mm rear.  

I’ll play some BF6 tomorrow to see if it cools any better but temps were good to begin with. 

I think this is the right amount of light. It looks much less bright in person, especially with the tinted glass installed.

Title: Please help - new hardware issues

Post: So I’ve recently built my own PC:

CPU: Intel Core i5-14600K
	•	CPU Cooler: DeepCool AG400 Plus
	•	Motherboard: ASUS B760M-MAX Gaming WiFi (DDR5)
	•	RAM: 32GB DDR5 (2×16GB)
	•	GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070
	•	SSD (main): Kingston NV3 1TB NVMe Gen4
	•	SSD (old): TeamGroup MP44L 1TB NVMe / TEAM MP33 (older models mentioned)
	•	PSU: DeepCool PN750M / Cooler Master MWE Gold V3 750W
	•	Case: Phanteks NV5S
	•	Case Fans: Corsair RS120 + Phanteks M25 G2 Reverse fans
	•	Monitor: Dell G2724D (1440p 165Hz IPS)

Everything has been fine prior to the below.

Today I was installing the fans. Three side and three top.

Whilst doing the install I had the PC connected to the power outlet (nothing else connected) just so I could make sure that the fans were all working properly.

Fast forward - fans installed no issues.

I then tried booting the PC up - ran a passmark benchmark and had no issues with that either.

Then I tried to play BF6.

The PC suddenly froze and crashed. Got a black screen BSOD warning messages but couldn’t recall it.

From here on, the PC keeps crashing and I’ve managed to capture these BSOD errors.

Stop code: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (OXA)
What failed: ntoskrnl.exe

PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA 0x50

CRITICAL PROCESS_DIED (OxEF)

There was also a memory error but I didn’t capture the actual code.

So I remember that I’ve got my old SSD that I had cloned onto a new SSD that still had my clone from a day ago. Thinking that it might just be some corrupted files.

I put the old SSD in, wipe the new SSD, then begin to clone it over to the new SSD.

7% into the cloning PC crashes again.

No error message this time - but it restarts into some low resolution mode, not safe mode.

So now I am running windows diagnostic tool and already it says ‘hardware problems were detected’.

I’ve spent the last 3 days building this PC and am struggling to continue even trying to find a solution 😂

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Bear in mind all parts are brand new.

It's an understatement as to how  beautiful this monitor is, it's close to looking through a window in some scenarios. The picture quality more than makes up for losing the ultrawide factor of my Alienware QD OLED 165HZ. Here's hoping that this setup will last me for a decent while.

Title: [FIXED] Weeks of GPU Crashes, Black Screens, 100 Percent Fans - The Real Cause Was Not What Windows Said It Was

Post: This is a full detailed breakdown of one of the most misleading hardware failures I have ever experienced.

If you have a 12VHPWR powered GPU and are dealing with random black screens or "driver crashes,"

this writeup might save you days or even weeks of troubleshooting.



\------------------------------------------------------------

1. SYMPTOMS I EXPERIENCED

\------------------------------------------------------------



The following problems slowly developed over time:



\- Black-screening mid-game with no warning

\- GPU fans instantly ramping to 100 percent

\- Complete system freeze with no keyboard or mouse input

\- Audio cutting out or looping

\- Required hard power-off every time

\- Battlefield 6 crashing far more often than any other game

\- Random NVIDIA "driver failure" crash dumps

\- Windows Event Viewer pointing to nvlddmkm.sys (misleading)

\- PAGE\_FAULT\_IN\_NONPAGED\_AREA crash dumps involving GPU memory addresses



Benchmarks were stable, which made the problem more confusing.



\------------------------------------------------------------

2. WHY THE ISSUE WAS EXTREMELY MISLEADING

\------------------------------------------------------------



Windows repeatedly blamed the NVIDIA driver.



Crash dumps suggested:

\- Driver corruption

\- GPU VRAM instability

\- PCIe bus issues

\- Bad riser cable

\- Memory faults



All false leads.



A split-second power dropout on the GPU makes Windows think

the driver stopped responding. It has no way of detecting a

physical power interruption, so it blames the driver stack.



This mimics:

\- GPU failure

\- PSU instability

\- PCIe signaling problems

\- Driver bugs

\- Overheating

\- Motherboard faults

\- BIOS problems

\- VRAM errors



\------------------------------------------------------------

3. WHY BATTLEFIELD 6 EXPOSED THE ISSUE FIRST

\------------------------------------------------------------



Battlefield 6 produces massive transient power spikes.



A slightly unseated 12VHPWR connector cannot handle these spikes.



Result:

\- GPU instantly shuts off

\- Fans default to 100 percent

\- System freezes

\- Windows logs a driver timeout (TDR)



This is why BF6 crashed constantly while other games were fine.



\------------------------------------------------------------

4. THE RISER CABLE RED HERRING

\------------------------------------------------------------



I was also using an old 2018 PCIe Gen3 riser cable, so I suspected:

\- PCIe lane instability

\- Riser degradation

\- Gen4 to Gen3 issues

\- BIOS PCIe settings



Perfect false lead.

Not related to the actual issue.



\------------------------------------------------------------

5. THE REAL ROOT CAUSE: A SLIGHTLY BENT AND UNSEATING 12VHPWR CABLE

\------------------------------------------------------------



My 12VHPWR cable was routed tightly inside the PSU shroud.

Over time, tension and heat cycles slowly pulled the connector

downward a millimeter at a time.



Facts about 12VHPWR:

\- It must be fully seated

\- Even a tiny gap causes intermittent power loss

\- Heat expansion and contraction makes it worse

\- A partially connected plug can still "work" but fail under heavy load



This caused:

\- Intermittent power dropouts

\- Black screens

\- Fan blast at 100 percent

\- Total system freeze

\- Misleading driver error logs



\------------------------------------------------------------

6. THE FIX

\------------------------------------------------------------



What I did:

\- Pulled the 12VHPWR connector completely out

\- Straightened the cable path

\- Removed all tension from under the PSU shroud

\- Ensured a straight insertion with full seating

\- Re-routed cables to prevent downward pull



After this:

\- Zero crashes

\- No black screens

\- No driver errors

\- BF6 completely stable

\- Even overclocks ran without issues



Absolutely confirmed the cable was the issue.



\------------------------------------------------------------

7. WHY THIS WAS "TROUBLESHOOTING HELL"

\------------------------------------------------------------



This issue perfectly imitates:

\- GPU failure

\- PSU undervoltage

\- Motherboard PCIe slot issues

\- Driver corruption

\- Windows corruption

\- Overheating

\- Bad riser cable

\- RAM instability

\- BIOS problems



One slightly loose cable created weeks of misleading symptoms.



\------------------------------------------------------------

8. TLDR - CHECK THIS FIRST

\------------------------------------------------------------



If you get:

\- Black screen

\- GPU fans instantly maxing out

\- Audio freeze

\- System lockup

\- Random driver timeouts

\- BF6 crashing more than other games

\- Stable benchmarks but unstable games



CHECK YOUR 12VHPWR CABLE.



Make sure:

\- It is fully seated

\- It is not bent within 35 mm

\- It has slack and no tension

\- The case panel is not pushing on it

\- Cable management is not pulling it sideways



Most people never suspect the cable,

but it is one of the most common sources of these problems.

Title: How do I know my PC reboots because of a PSU issue and not because of something else?

Post: Hi there

My 4 years old build started to reboot from time to time.

It does not happens every time but quite often. Basically I hear a click, all goes black and then it starts on its own again. 

I don’t see any pattern because it happens while browsing the web, sometimes while gaming. Sometimes not at all for the entire day.

Before swapping the PSU (that according to GPT is the issue) how can I be 100% sure?

MemTest is negative.

OCCT negative

Event Viewer shows Kernel-Power 41 errors

How do I know is not the Motherboard or the case?

Title: It looks like Bandai Namco or its developer is scamming during Black Friday Sale (Tales of Graces f Remastered)

Post: Why is Bandai Namco or the developer of Tales of Graces f Remastered doing this? As you can see in the pictures: Tales of Graces f Remastered is on sale for 35% off from $104.95NZD to be $68.21NZD. However, that $104NZD price tag was not the original price, it was increased from the original $69.95NZD price tag that you can see in the second picture from the other Tales of Xillia Remastered game which was released by the same publisher (different dev). I don't have the picture of the previous price of Graces f, but from my memory it WAS basically the same price as Xillia Remastered. Does Bandai Namco want to explain what's up? Is the failure that is season 3 of One Punch Man making them do this or something? Have any of you potentially noticed this as well in your own currency??

Title: My build, and my minor rant

Post: This is my first time actually building my own own pc so i went all out (in an acceptable level). I saved for 8 months and im broke now 😭😭😭. I have ordered everything, after making hours of research, reviews and videos. Everything arrived, EXCEPT the f****** motherboard which I am still waiting and I will prob wait for another 2 weeks (already been 16 days since the order).

I will write the specs down here just to make it easier for you.

Case: NZXT H7 flow rgb (2024)

Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z790-F WiFi 6e

GPU: Gigabyte Glgaming OC 16G Geforce RTX 5080

CPU: Intel i7-14700k

RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 Memory for AMD 64GB (2x32), 6000MHz, CL 30. (Was unlucky that I got it during price increase, hopefully earlier before it goes even higher)

Storage: 2x Samsung 990 PRO 2TB (lucky to buy it before the rise increase)

PSU: Seasonic focus GX-1000, 80 plus gold, ATX 3.1, PCle 5.1

AIO (cpu cooler): Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 A-RGB

Fans: -Front is the 3 RGB coming with the case -Bottom NZXT F120 RGB Core x3 (with the controller) -Top is the cpu cooler -Rear Corsair ML 140 RGB Elite. Only problem with the fans is the corsair rgb for being 4pin, so i ordered a wire that transforms it to 3 pin

Mouse: Logitech G502 X Plus, lightspeed wireless RGB

Mousepad: Benq G-SR-SE

Keyboard: ROG Strix Scope II 96% Wireless. Mechanical

Headset: Steelseries Arctic Nova Pro Wireless

Screen: LG Ultragear™ 32GS75Q-B

Desk: UTESPELARE gaming desk (IKEA)

I Additionally ordered and I am waiting for:

Main Screen: LG UltraGear 34" WQHD 34G630A-B

Monitor dual arm: VIVO Premium Aluminum Heavy Duty Arms STAND-V102G2

Additional small things: Thermalpase MX-6

Anti static wrist straps (i know they are useless and debunked. But better safe than sorry. Costed 5 aud for a pack of 3 so no biggy)

Display port wire 2.1 (might get another one)

HDMI 4K

x2 CAT 6 ethernet (1 for router to the wall socket, 1 for the socket to my pc)

Cable straps for cable management

RGB headset stand

2400W powerBoard with surge protection

All of these costed me 7,606.81 AUD (4,251.87 Euro, 4,909.44 USD)

I watched 1000 videos for building a pc, how to be careful, not what to do, what to do. I already pre-prepared the wires in the case, reading the manual so I could know how the cable management would look.

Before you say anything, i know i could go with 9800X3D cpu and the appropriate motherboard. However, after too much research I tried to build a fully compatible and stable pc for my AI work and high specs gaming that would be future proof. Its just that i seen that AMD bios has some problems i would like to avoid, also for my AI work it was more preferable to go with intel. I know that the screens are mid tier and not the highest, but would cost double the price for no real advantage for me since I am not an e-sport competitive level player.

Now I am just pissed that I do have everything ready, except the motherboard which I don’t even know when its coming. Since due to intel being money worshipers and introduced the new intel cpus which offers 0 advantage, and motherboards that are full of problems forcing manufacturers to discontinue the good motherboards, the one i wanted is out of stock from everywhere. I ordered it from amazon AU global market, and would come from amazon USA, and just keeps delaying. Z790-E which i would like, just got in stock in amazon AU global market, but its not worth canceling and ordering this one and wait further how many months.

Please let me know of your thoughts.

Title: This Dell XPS pre built was actually pretty nice to work with

Post: I was able to upgrade the graphics card from a 750ti to a 3050 and then use the surprisingly included 6+2 power connector to plug it in, but when I realized the psu was too weak I was then able to very easily swap it out for a better 500 watt EVGA one with no extra parts. I was also able to add a sata m.2 SSD and an extra hardrive with only an extra SATA power connector being required. The only proprietary plug is the sata slimline or whatever plug used on the disc drive but I have a 7 dollar adapter from Amazon which will fix that. 

Specs are an i7 6700, RTX 3050 8 gig, 32 gigs ddr4, a two and one tb hardrive, DVD burner optical drive, and a 512 gig m.2 ssd

Title: Marketing dirty work, but yeah… at least I’m helping people save money (Aliexpress US coupon 20%oOFF)

Post: Marketing Dirty Work, **It’s dirty work… but it actually helps people spend less.** If I can save someone $20, $50, even $120 on stuff they were already buying, then yeah, I’ll do the “dirty work.” I’ll dig through every tier, test every code, and drop it here so somebody else doesn’t have to waste time.

So if you’re in the US, here’s the real coupon ladder you can throw onto most orders during the 11.18 early Black Friday sale.

If one code fails or shows “invalid,” scroll to the PLAN B set.

# Main coupon ladder (US only · try these first):

$2 off $10：RDLFB2

$5 off $25：RDLFB5

$7 off $35：RDLFB7

$10 off $50：RDLFB10

$14 off $70：RDLFB14

$20 off $100：RDLFB20

$25 off $125：RDLFB25

$32 off $160：LF32A

$56 off $280：LF56A

$64 off $320：LF64A

$80 off $400：LF80A

$100 off $500：LF100A

$120 off $599：RDLFC120

# PLAN B backup codes

*(use these only if the ones above hit “invalid” or fully redeemed)*:

$7 off $35：BYLF7A

$16 off $109：BYLFA16A

$30 off $199：BYLFA30A

$45 off $299：BYLFA45A

$60 off $399：BYLFA60A

$75 off $499：BYLFA75A

$105 off $699：BYLFA105A

$29 off $160：BYLF29A

$58 off $320：BYLF58A

I know marketing gets clowned a lot.

But if “marketing dirty work” = you spend less money, then honestly? I’ll take that job every day.Saving money isn’t cringe—it’s common sense. 💸💪

Title: So I won the LG Ultragear GX9

Post: Just want to post showing I got my prize and to show people actually get the prize from these contests.

This monitor is great I've never owned a OLED before . I am running a 9070 XT so it it crushing my FPS a bit but I don't mine turning down settings a bit to us the great monitor.

I was using a 

Only thing I had an issue is claiming the contest I almost missed out. When I found out I won I was contacted buy a random mess on Reddit saying I had won, First thing I thought was ya right this is a scam I looked at the account just made under 30 days ago no karma no posts at all. So I went to another sub for LG found someone with a good account and messenged them and they looked into it and told me it was the right person.

So just a tip or requirement I think should be in the main post for contests should be the name of the person that will contact the winner.

Other that that was the shipping nightmare it was shipped November 10 and should have been delivered by the 11th but was not delivered because of wrong address. Oh ya nobody told me it was shipped never got a tracking number or a message that it was sent.

 Got a call from FedEx saying they needed the right address (yes I looked at the original address I sent to my contact, I gave him the correct address they just didn't put my apartment number or buzzer code on the package) and I would have a contact LG because they couldn't take the real address for me only the shipper. 

So I immediately sent an email to the contact I had telling them this they never replied. Got a call from LG on I think it was the 14th asking for the correct address I gave it to them they said here on Monday. Monday came and nothing showed up got a call from FedEx again on Tuesday saying nobody ever contacted them and if it wasn't resolved by Wednesday it would be shipped back to LG. 

Sent off another email same thing no answer wait another day got a call from FedEx again saying she talked to her supervisor and he got the address form me and overall policy to have it shipped me. I got it yesterday and all's well now.

Any questions I would be happy to answer.

Title: Should i switch only CPU or motherboard and CPU ?

Post: Hey everyone,

Here’s my current build:

* CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K
* Motherboard: ASUS Prime H270 PRO
* PSU: 650W
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 5060 (recently bought on sale)
* RAM: 16 GB

The issue is that in games like Fortnite, I’m getting heavy lag, and I think it’s due to the CPU.

My best friend gave me his B450 AORUS ELITE with an AMD Ryzen 5 2600. But I’m worried that the Ryzen 5 2600 will be quickly limited, or maybe it already is.

So I’m wondering: is it better to upgrade the CPU only and get a better one compatible with my current H270 motherboard? Or should I switch to the B450 AORUS ELITE and upgrade both CPU and motherboard?

Also, I’d like a processor that will still hold up well for at least the next 5 years.

My budget is around €300 to €400 max, and I’m also looking at Black Friday deals.

Thanks in advance for any advice!

    - OCCT
    - RAM check
    - Disabled EXPO

Title: Cat peed on my computer: Update

Post: (Update to my recent post) So first this morning I turned my PC on, the screen wasn’t showing anything and it smelt like burning plastic. I was out of it cause I just woke up and I turned it off a few minutes later after I realized the burning smell was my PC. Took the side panel off my PC and turned it on again, smoke or steam was billowing straight off of my GPU. I turned my whole computer on its side and cat piss came streaming out, I cleaned it up and it turned it back upright, it looked like remnants was on the bottom of the mobo and all over my GPU. I waved a white flag and posted here for hope and it seemed like my PC was done for. 

Then I went to work and came back, I bought a few strong beers and a black and mild, then poured about a half a gallon of 99% isopropyl alcohol all over the GPU and mobo over my sink. I ran it by a fan to dry it out and put it back together, no luck. Then I kept toggling the on and off switch on the PSU, finally it came on with no lights on the mobo, but nothing came up. Then about 5 minutes later of it running and still smelling like burnt plastic and cat piss, it came back to life. I don’t know how it’s still running, but it is. I officially stand by the parts my pc has. 

Other than my cat pissing in it, it has gotten cat puke, fell off my desk multiple times, a roach infestation from people I helped out by moving in my space, and more. It just keeps going. It feels like its on its last legs, but its number was not called today. I salute my PC for running above all, the only stable thing left in my life

Title: 🍂Autumn 2025 PC Best Buy Guide 🍂

Post: &gt;As it's been asked a lot over DM's: If you want to buy me a coffee, you're more than welcome to. These guides will ALWAYS stay free for everyone, and **I will never directly ask for any payment.** [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/xxstefanxx1) or [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xxstefanxx1) are both possible. If you want some in depth 1-on-1 guidance, shoot me a DM.

# $500 - $5000 Automatically updated [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com) lists!

Hi[ ](https://i.imgur.com/gDwhIXm.png)everyone, it's time for the Autumn version of the PC Best Buy Guide! Just to let you know: I'm expecting my first child in the next few weeks, so replies might be a bit slow the coming time!

If this is your first time here, here's how this guide works:

* Select a list that fits your budget, and this will take your to PCPartpicker.com.
* At the top right of the screen select your country that you'll be buying from. U.S. will de be default. Changing countries will automatically change the part selection to reflect availability and prices in your country and currency.
* Instead of having manually selected parts, the site will always select the cheapest option that satisfies the parametric selection or filter, while also maintaining intercompatibility between all parts.
   * For example, if the list has a parametric filter for RAM that says "2x16GB, 5600-6000 MT/s, 6-10ns", it will choose the cheapest set of RAM that fits this description, considering current availability, country, currency, etcetera.
* These lists are likely not 'perfect'. For example, there might be good deal on a certain product, but it might still be $1 more expensive than the cheapest option, thus it still won't show up in the list. You're always free to ask in the comments or a separate thread if a list can be optimized for your specific needs.

# Changed trends:

* Almost all GPUs are now at MSRP (except the 5090), which makes for better overall value PCs, especially in the lower tiers. AMD wins in the lower brackets of GPUs, while Nvidia edges it out in the higher tiers with their 5070 and 5070 ti. The 5080 is in a weird spot, being 40% more expensive than the 5070 ti, but only 10-15% faster. This makes it hard to recommend, as it also doesn't give you any more features.
* With older CPUs like the Ryzen 5600 going up in price, makes it hard to recommend a DDR4 based system currently. DDR5 continues to drop in price, while the slowest DDR5 is faster than the fastest DDR4 RAM. The Ryzen 5500 is currently the only super-budget CPU I would recommend at just $70. Beyond that, up until the Ryzen 5 7600, the i5 12400(F) at $110 is the only CPU for a gaming PC that makes sense.
* With the 5070 ti at MSRP, it doesn't make a TON of sense to get the 9070XT, though they're both great. Nvidia still offers the best overall features, so AMD still needs more raw performance to make up for that. 
* The 9060 XT is close to or at MSRP which makes it a fantastic mid-range GPU, greatly helping out with sub-$1000 builds!
*600-series of AM5 boards are starting to phase out and being replaced by B850. There's not a a big difference and you're fine with either.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[$500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=2hRJmG)|The most entry level (new) gaming PC I can somewhat recommend. |Change SATA SSD to NVMe SSD, 1TB optional; upgrade upgrade to RTX 5050 or B580. |2nd hand GPU; 2nd hand CPU+Motherboard+RAM combo|
|[$750](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=xnWDkL)|Some significant upgrades here. A faster CPU, 3rd party cooler, 32GB DDR5 RAM, stronger power supply, and a 1TB SSD. |Nvidia RTX 5060; i5 14600K(F) if you can get it under $150; a case you like.|Drop the 3rd party cooler (and use the included stock cooler),  swap the GPU with the Intel B580.|
|[$850](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=DD6snQ)|There are 2 options here: going for a Ryzen 7600 or upgrading the GPU to the 16GB variant. I chose the latter, as 8GB VRAM is becoming more problematic the coming years.|If you could spend around $900 total, getting the Ryzen 7600(X)/9600(X) is the only logical choice. Look at the $1000 list which motherboard/RAM to get.|Drop the 3rd party cooler (and use the included stock cooler)|
|[$1000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=YVsZzy)|Upgraded to the 16GB RTX 5060 ti for better performance and better feature support.  We also guarantee support for WiFi and Bluetooth.|2TB SSD; better case; dual tower cooler (from higher end lists below); |Drop back to the 9060 XT 16GB.|
|[$1200](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=9hRJmG)|Upgraded to a 2TB SSD and the RTX 5070 GPU, paired with an 850W ATX 3.0+ PSU |Upgrade the GPU to the RX 9070 XT|Drop back to a 1TB SSD. |
|[$1400](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=Hk4qBm)|Upgraded to the RTX 5070 ti. Alternatively, the RX 9070 XT is an excellent substitute.|Higher end cooler, higher end case.|Drop back to a 1TB SSD.|
|[$1600](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=Nk4qBm)|Upgraded the CPU to the 7800X3D as long as the price is decent. We also needed to improve cooling performance with a better cooler. Motherboard chipset is upgraded. |Upgrade directly to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Upgrade to liquid cooling. Higher end case. Higher end motherboard.|Drop back to a 1TB SSD.|
|[$1800](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=G3V6qs)|Upgraded to the 9800X3D. Better quality SSD. Bigger case. |Additional storage. Liquid cooling. Higher end case.||
|[$2000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=v87WBm)|Here we're flushing out the build. The RTX 5080 is in a very tough spot as it's just around 10-15% faster than the 5070 ti, while costing $250 more.  We get a high end motherboard, 4TB of SSDs, a high end case &amp; power supply. |Upgrade to the RTX 5080; you can also drop some of the storage for this upgrade, even though it's not great value. |Drop any of the multiple upgrades mentioned. |
|[$2500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=29hyqs)|If you do really want to spend more, you can max out your parts without overspending way too much. The RTX 5080 is your only option here, as the RTX 5090 is still way outside of reach. We're upgrading to liquid cooling, more storage, a higher end case with WiFi 7, and a platinum rated high end power supply. |You can pick any high end case you like. ||
|[$4000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=nQ8YQ7)|If you really want an RTX 5090, you'll have to pay up. AMD has no competitor here, so Nvidia can set the price wherever they like. |Anything you like!|Air cooling, less storage, lower end motherboard.|
|[$4000 (Themed)](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=b8WDkL)|An example of a themed build you can do. The ASUS ProArt line looks great, and has good quality. Do be wary of customer support issues that ASUS is experiencing currently.|||

# Workstation PCs:

|Budget|Note / compared to previous budget |Upgrades if the list is under your *budget (in order of priority):* |Downgrades if the list is *over budget (in order of priorty):*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[$700 2D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=78WDkL)|A basic, but fast &amp; high quality 2D workstation. 2D, as we don't have a powerful 3D accelerator in the form of a dedicated graphics card. Even with just $750 we're getting a very strong 20-core CPU and 32GB RAM. |More storage, more RAM (2x24GB, 2x32GB), high end power supply. |Core Ultra 5 245K.|
|[$1150 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=ntV6qs)|We upgrade the 2D workstation to a 3D one by adding a strong GPU like the RTX 5060 ti. This model with 16GB VRAM should give you a lot of room for many workstation tasks.|More storage, more RAM (2x24GB, 2x32GB), high end power supply. ||
|[$1500 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=ygD2bv)|We basically upgrade everything aside from the CPU and GPU themselves. We drastically increase the quality of things like the cooler, case, power supply, storage (+capacity), and more. |Alternatively, you can drop some of these upgrades and change the CPU instead to the Core Ultra 9 285K. ||
|[$1750 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=npZRgs)|Upgraded tot he Core Cultra 9 285K, and a higher end power supply. |||

Title: white pc build, minimal rgb

Post: Hello everyone!I've been working off of a gaming laptop thats permanently charging and its starting to make me worried since it starts huffing and turning off randomly even when I'm in the middle of using it... so here I am! I've helped my dad build his pcs in the past, but I'm looking to do mine on my own. Its also been a while since I've paid attention to this part of the world, so any advice would be much appreciated!

* New build or upgrade? Looking to build a new pc! 
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse?: I have 1 [monitor](https://us.msi.com/Monitor/Optix-G271/Specification)
* PC purpose? Gaming(Genshin Impact, modded Stardew Valley, I want to play baldur's gate 3 after upgrading! And emulating Love and Deepspace onto PC), audio editing, a lot of school work 
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center? USA, I live 20 minutes from a micro center
* Monitors needed? Nop! I really like the one I currently have!!
* Budget range? 800-1000usd. I'm cool with my games running on medium graphics but having them on high would be nice!
* WiFi or wired connection? Preferably wifi but I have access to Ethernet if its cheaper that way
* Size/noise constraints? Not huge? Like a standard sized one is fine, and preferably on the quieter side
* Color/lighting preferences? White and baby blue (if not baby blue just go all white), minimal rgb if possible(ik crazy but I have a white workspace already and more lights make it hard for me to focus)

Title: Help a momma out! New build for (almost) 14 year old son’s birthday

Post: I am a mom trying to get a gaming computer for my son’s 14th birthday and Christmas presents. I know literally nothing.  He has given me the things that he would like in a computer. He does know way more than me.  Hoping for a bit of help still to make sure he’s going in the right direction.   I have heard that build your own can be a tad less money than a prebuilt.  




New build or upgrade?

NEW! 

• Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

We have literally nothing. 


• PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/ games)

Gaming- VR Gaming, Ready or Not game in VR mode, Minecraft, Half Life Alex, Phasma Phobia
Modding / game coding 
Wants to run Unity and Blender Apps
Multitasking programming. 
(I don


• Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

USA.  Not near micro center. 


• Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

One monitor.   Honestly looking for the best bang for our buck. He’s saying 1080 would be fine, but I feel like that might not be that great. 

He was looking at 27” but I think that’s too big for his desk at this moment.  I’m thinking closer to 24”.  I think going a bit smaller size with better specs price wise would be better.  (I could totally be wrong as I don’t play computer games) 



• Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

Budget would be staying under $1400 including the monitor, keyboard and mouse. 🤞🤞


• WiFi or wired connection?

WiFi connection

• Size/noise constraints?

Not super concerned on noise, but the quieter the better 

• Color/lighting preferences?
No color or lighting preferences 

• Any other specific needs?

Looking for hopefully 32gb and 100fps for flat screen gaming.  

He has currently been looking at this prebuilt but I just don’t know.

Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

Need only 1 to buy so I can have a main monitor aswell as my other portable monitor. I'll preferably play 1080 or 1440p and I would like for the monitor to have a fast response time and high refresh rate. Preferably 1 ms and at least 180 hz or more.

Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

55k Philippine pesos or about 932 dollars.

Wifi or Wired Connection?

I'm gonna use both wifi and Ethernet to be honest. I'm gonna use wifi for light games, while I'll use Ethernet for downloading and games that I want less ping on.

Size/noise constraints?

Gonna buy a new table so should fit and noise might be an issue only if it's getting really loud.

Color/lighting preferences?

RGB would be cool but i would much rather get the best value even if it means losing RGB.

Any other specific needs?

None

Also something that he would be able to upgrade over the coming years 

What would you guys recommend or have you been in a similar situation with what to get your own kids ?

Purchase country? Near Micro Center? I’m in Los Angeles, and have a Microcenter somewhat near me

Title: Which 4k Monitor are actually worth It in the black friday Sales? Budget is 800-1200$

Post: Monitor Upgrade for work and content consumption/gaming Budget is 800-1200$  
  
I'm looking at 4k monitor black friday deals to upgrade my 1080p Asus monitor and wanted to hear from people who have already been browsing or buying this year.

I need something mainly for mixed productivity and entertainment since I work from home part of the week but also watch a lot of shows on the same setup. I'm in the US and trying to stay in the midrange price bracket without getting stuck with a panel that has awful QC or ghosting. Ideally something around 27 to 32 inches that will last a while.

I've checked Amazon and a few brand sites but the sale options feel all over the place.

What 4k monitors are you all considering or recommending from the current Black Friday deals?

* New build or upgrade? = upgrade
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links) = asus tuf 1080p
* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) = working/gaming
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors) = US
* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)= 27 - 32
* Budget range? (Include tax considerations)= 800 - 1200$
* WiFi or wired connection? = wired
* Size/noise constraints? = any
* Color/lighting preferences? = black
* Any other specific needs? = just monitor

Title: $3,000 CAD 3D/2D/Video workstation

Post: Looking to finally get a proper workstation. I've been using a 980ti for years and feel my 3D work is getting impeded by it.

**New build or upgrade?**

New build

**Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)**

Reusing monitors, mouse and keyboard. Not sure on the exact model of monitors, but my primary one uses Displayport, secondary is HDMI, and third is a CRT that uses VGA, which is currently adapted to Displayport. Both of the regular monitors are 1080p.

**PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**

Will be used most of the time for 2D and 3D graphics/video. Blender, Photoshop, Substance Painter, After Effects, Premiere.

 Will be used occasionally for games, but the machine should be built more around productivity.

Also intend to use it for a basic home media setup, like having it connected to a TV for watching movies/series. 

**Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If you're not in a country supported by PCPartPicker, please list some local vendors)**

Canada - British Columbia (no Micro Center)

**Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)**

Want to use the 3 I already listed, + able to connect to a TV.

**Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**

$3,000 CAD

**WiFi or wired connection?**

Ideally both are possible

**Size/noise constraints?**

No

**Color/lighting preferences?**

Discreet

**Any other specific needs?**

I've seen some people do builds in old 90s PC Cases. I'd like to do this if possible, but I recognize it would take some DIY. If not possible, I'm looking for a cheap, discreet case. I don't need gamer lights or glass panels or anything fancy.

Title: First PC $800-$1000 for Mechanical Engineering student and Gaming

Post: Hello guys! I’m a college student and am looking to get a PC sooner than I expected as next semester (January) I’ll need one/was recommended to have one for my engineering classes. It being Black Friday soon along with Holiday deals coming I thought it best to look into now. I’ll be doing school work and gaming, also already have things like keyboard, mouse, monitor, so really just need the PC. As for money it is a concern in that its either keep saving for a car or get a pc rn. I believe it’s better to get a PC as I’d theoretically be saving on parts but im honestly not familiar with deals for pc parts. Do want to say I have no real knowledge on anything PC so sorry if some things i say r dumb. Any and all advise/suggestions would be great!

Performance over looks 

**New build or upgrade?**

* New 

**Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)**

Monitor:

* Gigabyte M27Q (Rev 2.0) -[(27” 1440 165hz)GigabyteLink](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/M27Q-rev-20/sp#sp)

**PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**

College/ Mechanical Engineering:

* CAD, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, *maybe other idk* Gaming:
* Overwatch 2, Minecraft (Modded) 
* Rimworld, Boulders Gate 3, Xbox gamepass games
* maybe: cyberpunk, Skyrim/olderFallouts (Modded), *maybe* Photoshop/Art
* Affinity

**Purchase country? Near Micro Center?**

* USA -California
* 3:40± hour drive from Tustin (Love me a GOOD excuse to go to LA)

**Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)**

* None have one

**Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**

* $800-1000

**WiFi or wired connection?**

* Wired but WiFi option would be nice in case of anything

**Size/noise constraints?**

Size

* Smaller would be nicer but likely more expensive so idk how worth it’d be

Noise

* Can’t be too noisy as likely late night working/gaming and id be in bedroom

**Color/lighting preferences?**

* Functionality/price over looks
* Dislike/don’t care for RGB 
* prefer darker colors. Colors i like Black, Red, White, Lilac,  

**Any other specific needs?**

* 16 gigs of ram goal is 32 gigs
* 1TB of storage 

**More info/reasoning:**

\-Specs / uses

School (priority)

From the little research I’ve been able to do engineering software is hefty in space hence the min TB 

And ram 16 is enough but 32 is best for speed? Honestly not sure what ram is Just know more = less frustration 

Also from what i found depending on type of software GPU is more important then CPU and others CPU over GPU but i got no idea what this means

Gaming

Id love to get the most outta my monitor meaning being able to keep a consistent max fps of 165 in shooters like/mainly Overwatch even if its 1080p also having 1440p in games where fps ain’t the point.

I have a IPad m2 so photoshop/art aint rly important. I also have an Xbox series s so if games rnt going to be the greatest well poverty strikes again but it’s about time i go to pc gaming so it would be nice.

\-Budget

Money is a concern seeing as it’s either pc now and car in late January/march or car sooner and pc late January, n with rides being plenty a pc seems better.

**I would be willing to spend more but from what I am told this should work for what I need (School**, gaming sadly is secondary). I can always upgrade later.

\-Micro center / deals

Id be willing to consider a 4 hour trip down to LA on short notice but the deals?/reason to go would need to be good. Could it even be worth? Idk what it rly is beyond hearing its a good place for computers but idk

Do keep in mind any student discounts as id qualify

I also **prefer Amazon as i have prime** also saw a GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GPU on Amazon for $570 is this worth? I can buy rn rn if you think its worth type shit

* Would/could it be worth to get some parts rn with Black Friday deals and others not on deal wait n get with Christmas deals

—-

Would also appreciate any advice on learning more about PC’s as for the most part I’m completely lost and with work and finals slowly approaching time isn’t a plenty to do mass research before Black Friday. I love learning new stuff so the more info the merrier.

questions i have:

* Is this price range good/reasonable for what i need?
* Is this range/ what is the range to get the most outta my monitor?
* Would y’all recommend having/getting a 2nd monitor eventually?
* I’d love me a good wireless gaming mouse any recommendations on that (outside of budget)? Is that super light 2 worth? 
* any recommendations on a cheap shit webcam for school (outside of budget)?

sorry for any writing mistakes or the such I been doing nothing but code for the last 3/4 days brains mush. Also sorry for the loads of detail felt more would be better

Thanks lots for the any and all help!

Post: Hi all. Looking into building a new PC for the first time in 10 years. Wondering if any websites/stores are offering any solid Black Friday/cyber Monday deals that I can take advantage of. If this isn't really a thing anymore, let me know, I have a PS5 so I'm not in a major rush to build if the deals aren't there. 

**New build or upgrade?**

* New build, will need everything 



**Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)** 

* n/a. I have an SSD from a 10 year old build lying around somewhere but assume starting from scratch 



**PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**

* Gaming/workstation. Want to play new titles like Civ 7, Subnautica 2, Expedition 33 at 60fps+ med/high settings. Also looking to play older games like Warframe and modded Minecraft along with emulation. 
* I will be using the PC for work and grad school stuff as well but it won't need to do much beyond word processing for that. 



**Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors)** 

* Chicago, USA, near a micro center. 



**Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)** 

* 1 monitor to start, maybe around 27". 1440p/144hz minimum refresh rate. Gsync/Vsync would be nice but not necessary.

**Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**

* 1500 USD max 

 **WiFi or wired connection?** 

* Will need to do both. 

**Size/noise constraints?** 

* Prefer microatx 

**Color/lighting preferences?** 

* Classy/minimal. Don't need or want any crazy RGB.

**Any other specific needs?**

* I have a basic keyboard and mouse set I can use for now but recommendations for midrange options for both of those would be appreciated. Thanks for any advice.

Title: First Time PC Build - Sense Check Compatability Please!

1st time PC builder - looking to do a new build for my first gaming PC. 

I've pulled together the following list, please review and let me know if there's any replacements / upgrades I should make. I want to ensure all parts are compatible before I start ordering.

The main thing i'm unsure on is the graphics card - I don't really play new high intensity graphics based games, should I downgrade the 9060 XT?

Title: Hybrid Gaming PC / HTPC - £3k - will tip the chosen option

Post: Hello lovely people,

Not my first build ever but have been out the game for 10 years so in need of help…

More of a couch gamer these days so I’m looking for the best possible rig in the most compact size that could fulfil both office and living room gaming needs.

I’m open to casting to the TV, otherwise the primary monitor would be a 55in LG OLED for most of the time.

And as title suggests, happy to tip the chosen selection - leave me a link.

*THANK YOU IN ADVANCE*

New build or upgrade?
New Build

Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)
55in LG OLED

PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)
Highest-quality gaming as possible - I’d expect smooth 4k/144 new releases for this budget. If I’m wrong please advise and I’ll flex budget.
Ease-of-use in living room.

Purchase country?
United Kingdom.

Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)
N/A if using the 55inch LG OLED.
However 1x recommendation for decent size, best quality monitor would be helpful too. This recommendation can exceed the budget.

Budget range? (Include tax considerations)
Up to £3k excluding monitor.
Can flex budget if needed for what I’m asking.

WiFi or wired connection?
Either

Size/noise constraints?
As compact as possible without compromising quality of gaming, the parts, or limiting future upgrades/changes (I accept that to upgrading to new parts in the future may mean a new case so that needs to be possible too)

Color/lighting preferences?
A single colour theme would be cool - I’m open to suggestions. Presumably since I’m asking for something small this would limit visual and theme options? If you can tell me what options are available that would be good?

Any other specific needs?
1) Strong preference for nvidia 4/5 series but acknowledge that this will impact case size.
2) Since I’m out the loop on casting / Moonlight / other living room options any advice or considerations of this in your rig would be helpful.

Title: Future-Proof Gaming/Workstation Upgrade – €1000 Budget (Netherlands)

Post: Hi everyone,

I’m looking for a sanity check on my planned upgrade. I’ve been running an **i7-10700K + RTX 4070 Ti** for a few years, recently upgraded with a **5120x1440@144Hz monitor**, and I’m starting to notice my CPU struggling in games and when multitasking. My goal is to **future-proof my PC** for gaming (any games), programming, and heavy multitasking, with **minimal upgrades needed down the road**.

* New build or upgrade?: New
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links): [https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/user/Subman/saved/#view=Hp22bv](https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/user/Subman/saved/#view=Hp22bv)  My current case required… *creative adjustments* (hammer included), so I’d like something more polished this time.
* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games): Gaming, programming, mostly like to keep open alot off stuff at once so it needs to handle that.
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors): Netherlands using mostly [tweakers.net](http://tweakers.net) for price references
* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate): No
* Budget range? (Include tax considerations): stretch but like to keep it well under 1000 euros
* WiFi or wired connection?: Wired, not against wifi but not required per se
* Size/noise constraints?: quiet is nice, but not required
* Color/lighting preferences?: **black/RGB** build that looks clean (no tacky lighting).
* Any other specific needs?: No

[https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/user/Subman/saved/#view=zhtQf7](https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/user/Subman/saved/#view=zhtQf7)

Doing some research myself I came up with the above list. But it seems the case might not be compatible with the cpu cooler, would this work for the combination of parts that are listed?  
I am also not really familliar with current hardware and what is best currently so any advice is greatly appreciated.

I am also open to good case reccomendations, I listed the F6 flow for now as I found it to look quite good. Case reccomendations are also more than welcome! 

Thanks!

Title: First time PC build

* New build or upgrade?: New
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links): Existing monitor - Samsung C27RG50FQR
* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games): Daily use, some moderate editing (personal use, nothing crazy), Gaming
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors): I am looking at [Amazon.de](http://Amazon.de) but based in Bulgaria
* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate): No
* Budget range? (Include tax considerations): up to 1500 EUR
* WiFi or wired connection?: Wired, but wifi capability would be a plus
* Size/noise constraints?: No
* Color/lighting preferences?: Black, minimal RGB
* Any other specific needs?: No

Here’s what I have chosen so far.

Case: NZXT H5 Flow (Black, Tempered Glass); 70 EUR on [Amazon.de](http://Amazon.de) now

Title: Building my first PC

Post: I always used to buy prebuilts in the past so I thought it’s finally time to build my first pc since black friday is coming up.

New build or upgrade?

New build

• Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

I have a good keyboard and mouse already.

• PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps)

Gaming

• Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

United States, not near a micro center

• Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

2500-3000 USD

• WiFi or wired connection?

Both would be cool

• Size/noise constraints?

Doesn’t really matter too much but quieter would be nice

• Color/lighting preferences?

Don’t need rgb just performance. I wouldn’t mind if it was there though.

• Any other specific needs?

I would prefer an AMD processor and an NVIDIA graphics card if possible.

Thanks in advance

Title: Opinions on a $2000+ Gaming PC?

Post: Opinions on this build?  It will be my first gaming PC

* New build or upgrade? 

NEW

* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

No existing parts/monitors to reuse

* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)

Primary purpose is solo gaming, Elden Ring, Souls-like games.  Not interested in online gaming.

* Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

In the United States, very close to a Micro Center

* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

Single monitor, not too big.

* Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

$2500 to $3500 is ok.  Budget should include monitor, keyboard.

* WiFi or wired connection?

Connection will be WiFi

* Size/noise constraints?

Space is an issue, so something smaller, easy to put on a cart to move as needed.

Want to game on the couch, not sitting at a desk.

Quiet is good as this will be in a living area, not in a separate room.

* Color/lighting preferences?

Classic, elegant, not too flashy.  Liked the wood with black/brown accents.

* Any other specific needs?

New to putting together a computer, so ease of assembly a consideration.

•	⁠PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) - a mixture of Gaming (AAA games) and video editing (2k/4k, rare times 6k on Davinci Resolve)

•	⁠Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors) - Not near a Micro Center or local vendors but am in US

•	⁠Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate) - Alienware 34” ultrawide Oled

•	⁠Budget range? (Include tax considerations) - $2000-2500

So obviously I’m wanting to build a PC that works well for triple A gaming and also 2k/4k/super rare occasions 6k on davinci resolve. I have an Intel build but would like to see an AMD equivalent build to the list I have. If I could just see the difference in motherboard, CPU, and SSD if needed and keep the same design/theme. Thank you in advance!

Title: Building my first new build PC - UK £2-£2.5k

Post: Hi all

Looking to build my first gaming PC at around £2-2.5k (can go a bit over if absolutely necessary) but never done this before. Any guidance/help would be greatly appreciated. My current rig is around 6 years old and hoping to get a replacement that can also last the test of time.

I based the below on the Autumn best PC guide, albeit I think the UK is slightly more expensive than the US, so I am not sure if the below is still the best value for money.

- Budget range? £2k - £2.5k?

Title: Europe based 2400€ gaming PC new build

Post: Hello guys! I'm trying to build a pc for gaming and school work stuff. I'm from hungary, europe. I don't really know a lot about this stuff, and i don't want to buy something that is overkill so i ask for your help. Thank you in advance!

* New build or upgrade?: This will be a new build
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links): I don't have any parts to reuse.
* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games): I will be using this for gaming, gta V, (possibly gta VI if ever released on pc), unreal engine 5 simulations, other various simulations.
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center?: Hungary, so european prices unforunately.
* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate): I'd like 1 monitor which won't bottleneck the performance, it can be over the budget.
* Budget range? (Include tax considerations): For the PC, it is 2400 euro.
* WiFi or wired connection?: Wired.
* Size/noise constraints?: These are not important for me.
* Color/lighting preferences?: No preferences.
* Any other specific needs?: I need nvidia gpu for cuda support and at least 16 gb of vram to run simulators.

Title: 10 year-old build passed away today

Post: Hello everyone!

Im looking to purchase a new build since my old one has had multiple issues recently &amp; im no longer happy about spending time figuring out how to work around issues or fixing problems within.



1. **New build or upgrade?**
   * A brand new one, my old build is too old for upgrades.
2. **Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)**
   * Im buying two new Omen or Asus monitors for the new PC - I would like to try dual screening as i have never done it before. Second screen would mostly be for discord / vods &amp; chats.
3. **PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)**
   * Casual gaming - Mostly playing low need games as League of Legends &amp; World of Warcraft (20 years in a row) - but if some new MMORPG comes up idd like to have the ability to play it at more than mediocre settings.
   * Used to playing on low settings, would like to play on close to max settings in the future
4. **Purchase country? Near Micro Center?**
   * I live in France and Denmark, depending on the year.
5. **Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)**
   * Again, if you have any advice for dual screen use idd like them. Been looking at Omen screens &amp; asus recently.
6. **Budget range? (Include tax considerations)**
   * Ideally, around 1400-1500 euros, give or take. Would like it to be future-proof, if they suddenly drop Wow 2.0.
7. **WiFi or wired connection?**
   * I have a wired connection, but a Wifi port would be nice as backup / lans
8. **Size/noise constraints?**
   * As my PC is settles in the living room where my GF tends to watch movies on the side, Low noise would be preffered.
9. **Color/lighting preferences?**
   * As its in the living room, i have no prefferences - its somewhat hidden away. Dont need to spend power on lights - Total black is perfect.
10. **Any other specifik needs?    I would love to build the PC myself, although i have never tried it before. I feel like it would get my closer to it &amp; also make it easier to upgrade or fix later in life if needed.** 

  
Thank you so much for this amazing forum.

Title: Building my first Desktop PC - Would appreciate your help :)

Post: Hello people :)

I am looking to build my first desktop PC - a week ago, I was completely clueless about terms like RAM, SSD, GPUs, etc. So please, go easy on me, as I'm a starter here.

* New build or upgrade? **New build, 100%**
* PC purpose? **Gaming (Total War: Warhammer 3, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and overall, being able to run games launched till 2025, smoothly)**
* PC purpose? **Business (I'm an SEO/Digital Marketing Guy) - nothing too extreme, 2-3 Excel sheets, 5-6 Chrome Tabs and perhaps a program at the same ti**me
* Purchase country? **Europe, Greece - best place to look for parts is** [**https://www.skroutz.gr/**](https://www.skroutz.gr/)
* Budget range? **2.800 Eur, I would say**
* WiFi or wired connection? **Both**
* Size/noise constraints? **The quieter, the better**
* Colour/lighting preferences? **Nope, let's keep this minimal**
* Monitor? **Already have one, but will defo get a new one in 2026**

So after doing some initial research, I have produced the following builds. The only differ in CPU Cooler and GPU.

=================

Lastly, about the RAM, I have read that "EXPO 6000–6400 is the AMD ideal. Ryzen generally prefers 6000–6200 MT/s for stability." Therefore, an alternative RAM was proposed to me (by AI), this one - [https://www.skroutz.gr/s/38440998/G-Skill-Flare-X5-32GB-DDR5-RAM-with-2-Modules-2x16GB-and-6000-Speed-for-Desktop-F5-6000J3636F16GX2-FX5.html](https://www.skroutz.gr/s/38440998/G-Skill-Flare-X5-32GB-DDR5-RAM-with-2-Modules-2x16GB-and-6000-Speed-for-Desktop-F5-6000J3636F16GX2-FX5.html)

Title: Advice needed for a high end white AORUS RTX 5080 build

Post: Hi everyone,



* New build or upgrade? New build
* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? Gigabyte RTX 5080 AORUS Master ICE, Kingston Fury Beast rgb 2x16 6000 cl36
* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) Gaming
* Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If not US, list local vendors) I'm in Hungary, so my main vendors are : [alza.hu](http://alza.hu) , [ipon.hu](http://ipon.hu) , [oaziscomputer.hu](http://oaziscomputer.hu)

*pcpartpicker only lists alza as vendor*

* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate) No, I already have a 34" 3440 x 1440 180 Hz
* Budget range? (Include tax considerations) 3400$
* WiFi or wired connection? Would appreciate both, using wire atm but you never know
* Size/noise constraints? No constraints, less noise -&gt;better (I have a gaming laptop it's hell)
* Color/lighting preferences? All white build, but open to anything
* Any other specific needs? No

I need some advice for a new build.  
I already bought my GPU and RAM, and now I want to finalize the rest of the components, but I'm not fully confident about my choices and would like objective input, I think I went a little overboard with aorus parts because i'm obsessed with how it looks. Also scared because too many screens (GPU and AIO).

**What I want to build :**

Full white

Balanced RGB

Clean visual aesthetic

Easy rgb sync across all components

**What I am considering right now (but open to change):**

Case: Lian Li O11D Evo RGB White NZXT H9 Flow RGB 2025 

Motherboard: Gigabyte X870E Aorus Pro Ice

CPU: Ryzen 7 9800X3D

AIO: AORUS Waterforce X II White or Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 A-RGB

Fans: AORUS EZ Chain 120 ICE (because of clean cabling + ecosystem)

PSU: AORUS Elite 1000W Platinum ATX 3.1 (White)

**Main goal:**

A premium, clean, tasteful, white themed build, where the components match visually.

Any advice from people who built similar setups would be super helpful.  
Thanks in advance!

Title: Why did Intel Optane Persistent Memory/ 3D Xpoint not take off?

Post: The title, with Ram turning out to be such a huge factor for AI, and with Those old Optane DDR sticks having 128GB -512GB capacities per DIMM. What happend? I remember that it came and then was quickly killed off due to not being price competitive, but in a world like today the tech could have improved so much?

Title: Why does Intel use the opposite terminology for "dispatch" and "issue"?

Post: When reading through various CPU optimization manuals, it seems that most vendors use the following terminology when defining the stages of the CPU pipeline:

- Dispatch: Transferring the uops from the frontend to backend(allocating a ROB + scheduler entry along with other resources)
- Issue: when the uop is sent from the scheduler to the execution unit to be executed


[AMD](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/58455_1.00), [Arm](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109757/0301/?lang=en), [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/cpu-optimization-guide) (you need a developer account to access their optimization guide), and the [RISCV Boom](https://docs.boom-core.org/en/latest/) microarchitecture docs all use the above terminology.

However, Intel seems to use the term "dispatch" to refer to when uops are sent to the execution unit, and "issue" for when uops are sent from the frontend to the backend. [LLVM]( https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/39d4dfbe55cbea6ca7d506b8acd8455ed0443bf9/llvm/lib/Target/X86/X86ScheduleZnver4.td#L2)  also uses Intel's terminology, however, I believe this is because Intel cpus were one of the first CPUs they created a scheduler model for, although this could be wrong.

Does anyone know why Intel defines these terms differently from the rest of the industry? Not hating on Intel, I'm just curious.

Edit:
You can see Intel's use of the terminology when looking at their [perf events](https://perfmon-events.intel.com/):

- UOPS_ISSUED.ANY: Counts the number of uops issued by the front end every cycle.
- UOPS_DISPATCHED.ALU: Number of ALU integer uops dispatch to execution.

They also use the same definitions in their software optimization manual.

Title: Is the TPU really an ASIC?

Post: I know all of the branding says its an ASIC, but is it really an ASIC or an ASIP? It feels like it does too much for it to be an ASIC. Can someone clarify please. Also, would Amazon's Trainium be the same?

Title: IBM and Cisco want to build a quantum internet by the late 2030s

Post: &gt;Today they announced plans to collaborate on a large-scale and fault-tolerant network that will enable tens of thousands of so-called “qubits” to work together to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. The companies said they hope to realize their vision within just five years by linking two separate quantum computers and entangling their qubits, before expanding this network to many dozens of machines over a distributed network.
&gt;
&gt;Ultimately, they’re aiming to build the foundation of a “quantum internet” by the late 2030s. It’s intended to support ultra-secure communications and advanced sensor networks for seismic monitoring, climate change and other applications.

Title: Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite Series: Overview and benchmarks for the new top SoC for ARM notebooks

Post: Qualcomm was kind enough to invite us to San Diego last week for its first Architecture Deep Dive for the Snapdragon X2 series. The chip giant had already provided initial insights into the new ARM-based platform for Windows PCs during the summit in Hawaii (we reported).

These insights were now to be explored in greater depth on site. In addition to the top-of-the-range Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme (96-100) SoC, Qualcomm also took a closer look at the two smaller chips: the Snapdragon X2 Elite with 12 and 18 cores respectively.

Thanks to FastConnect 7800, both support Wi-Fi 7 with tri-band support and Bluetooth 5.4. The Snapdragon X75 modem system supports 5G with up to 10 GBit/s download and 3.5 GBit/s upload speeds.

A total of 53 MB of cache is available to the two 18-core models, and 34 MB to the 12-core model. All can access 9 MB of last-level cache. In addition to dual NVMe, all modern SD standards are supported and up to three additional displays can be powered. These can operate at either 4k up to 144 Hz or 5k / 60 Hz. Lower resolutions do not allow for higher refresh rates or more displays.

Title: The Pro-Consumer Case for Using Harmonic Mean to Calculate FPS Averages

Post: tl;dr: If someone is buying a GPU with a particular frame rate experience in mind (e.g. 4k @ 60 FPS, 1440p @ 144 FPS), the Harmonic Mean, which is designed for calculating averages of rates/frequencies, is a better representation than the Geometric Mean (used by, for example, Hardware Unboxed). Geometric Mean exaggerates FPS by \~10% compared to Harmonic Mean, so a consumer targeting a specific "general" frame rate will unknowingly be buying an underpowered card for their use case.

I get that choosing how to represent data always involves tradeoffs. If someone only cares about how strong one card is relative to another, whether you use the arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic mean generally won't make much of a difference (they will all be within a few points of each other), but if someone is targeting a specific "experience," it does.

Many reviewers already recognize that using Geometric Mean is more "representative" of the card's general performance than arithmetic mean. That is true, because geometric mean effectively reduces the influence of outliers (e.g. high FPS competitive games like CS). But mathematically, geometric mean is designed for use with growth rates (e.g. interest rates, stock returns). There is an even better kind of mean that is specifically designed for use with frequencies/rate (e.g. frames *per second*): the harmonic mean.

If you are looking for a specific "experience" with games, like "I want to enjoy my story-driven RPGs at *at least* 60 FPS @ 4k" or "I want to consistently max out my 144 Hz monitor," then harmonic mean will be the most helpful statistic for you. These "experiences" boil down to average frame time (smoothness) and/or average latency (responsiveness), which correspond to the inverse of FPS and happen to be exactly the kind of thing that harmonic mean is meant to calculate for.

For instance, many console games have a mode that targets 40 FPS, because in terms of frame time and latency, 40 FPS is the average of 30 FPS (the "quality" mode) and 60 FPS (the "performance" mode). You can verify this by taking the average of 1/30 and 1/60 and comparing it to 1/40. In this case, the arithmetic mean of 30 and 60 is 45, the geometric mean is \~42, and the harmonic mean correctly comes out to 40.

I pulled from the [TechPowerUp ASUS RX 9070](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-radeon-rx-9070-tuf-oc/) data to create a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTubyThpayiBdQLk-dgk6iyRvgEJc43cy0WFBxRmFE371wEJ1Q4JZieMc2WOGjG7eyJtpvHdU-dNFj9/pubhtml) showing how the different methods of calculating the mean might affect someone's buying decision. (notes: 1. I know the formatting is garbage, but I highlighted the most important bits. 2. I only realized that cards launched after the RX 9070 aren't represented after I made it. Oh well. 3. I only used the first 20 of the 24 games, so that's why my averages differ slightly from theirs. It doesn't really affect the conclusion).

If you are after a "4K @ 60 FPS" experience, the arithmetic mean would lead you to purchase something similar in power to an RX 7900 GRE/4070 Super. If you go by the geometric mean, you would purchase something about as powerful as an RTX 5070. But with both of these options, you would likely find yourself having to turn down settings or accept a lower frame rate more often than you anticipated. In reality, you would need something closer to a 3090 Ti/4070 Ti Super to achieve that goal. If that class of card is financially out of reach, then at least you have that data and can adjust your expectations or decide to wait until the next generation. Obviously upscaling can alleviate the issue, but the point still stands: if you are targeting a specific performance level across a variety of games, harmonic mean is more helpful to you as a consumer than geometric mean.

When many reviewers are already using the more complicated geometric mean, I don't see much of a downside to switching to a metric that is even more pro-consumer. I don't even expect reviewers to go back and update previous reviews, I'm just suggesting to use this metric going forward. People who are looking to buy the most expensive card they can afford, or the "best value" card, or a card that is x times as strong as their current card will not be affected at all. But people looking for specific frame rates will be better equipped to make a decision.

Edit: For those who want more of the math. The term "average" is usually associated with the arithmetic mean. This is the basic one that you learn early on in math class:

`(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n)/n`

Geometric mean is calculated by multiplying all of the numbers together and then taking the nth root

`nth root of (x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n)`

If you've ever done a math problem like "you invest in a stock. In year one, you gain 15%, in year 2, you gain 10%.... Calculate the average return," then geometric mean is useful for solving that.

Harmonic mean is calculated by taking the inverse of the sum of inverses:

`n/[(1/x_1) + (1/x_2) + ... + (1/x_n)]`

If you've done a problem about different pumps filling a pool at different rates, or calculating average round-trip speed if you're driving one speed on the way out and another on the way back, harmonic mean is the way to go, because it is designed to help with averaging rates.

For an extreme example, take a GPU that does 30 FPS in game 1, 60 FPS in game 2, and 1000 FPS in game 3. The arithmetic mean would give 363 FPS. The geometric mean would give 122 FPS, and the Harmonic Mean would be 59 FPS. Which number do you feel is the most accurate representation of the card's performance? It's obviously subjective to a degree, but if you buy this card thinking you'll be maxing out your 120 Hz monitor in most games, you will likely be disappointed; however, if you buy this game thinking it's around the 60 FPS mark, you'll probably be much more satisfied, because the card roughly meets the expectations and can far exceed them in some cases.

This is an artificially extreme case, but the extreme cases can help to understand the general principle that is still true in more typical cases. As I said in the original post, when the gaming sample size is bigger and more varied, the difference between geometric mean and harmonic mean decreases, but doesn't go away entirely. It tends to remain around a 10% difference, which is relatively small, but could mean that, if you look at FPS averages and expect that general level of performance across games, the geometric mean inflates the averages by 0.5-1 tier of performance, so a buyer may be disappointed when their card is not reaching that level in many games.

And again, at the point where reviewers are already using geometric mean, why not use the metric that is exactly designed for the mathematical use case instead of the one that gets kind of close?

Title: Component lifecycle management - how do hardware engineers handle this?

Post: Curious how hardware engineers manage component sourcing and lifecycle tracking.



Recent frustration: Finished PCB design, component went EOL without warning. 2 days of work lost.



Questions:

1. What tools do you use for component research?

2. How do you prevent selecting EOL parts?

3. Does your company use specialized software?

4. What would make this easier?



Current options seem inadequate:

\- Octopart (API paywall, data quality issues)

\- SiliconExpert (expensive, enterprise only)

\- Manual checking (time consuming)



Would something better be useful or is this just part of the job?



Background: Developer considering building this, validating if it's a real pain point.

Title: Chancellor Merz: "Will not allow components from China in 6G network"

Post: Merz also plans to bring this up on the topic at the [European Summit for Digital Sovereignty](https://bmds.bund.de/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/detail/europaeischer-gipfel-zur-digitalen-souveraenitaet-2025) :

&gt;At the summit, the industry should discuss what can be done not only to become more independent from China, but also from the USA and the major technology companies, Merz is further quoted as saying. However, Merz ruled out a complete decoupling from China. The country is Germany's second-largest trading partner. While China cannot decouple from Germany either, Germany can still do less with China.

Title: Why do mobile CPUs even have frequency scaling? Why don't they just always run at the peak of their efficiency curve when they're not parked?

Post: Running at other frequencies is running at lesser efficiencies than the chip is capable of, which would waste power for any workloads with a finite amount of work. So why don't they just run at the highest efficiency all the time?

* High Bandwidth Monitors and GPU Scaling Behavior - [Link Here](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5694)
   * High bandwidth monitors are those that support display modes requiring high pixel clock rates, which in turn demand more GPU resources. The threshold for what qualifies as "high bandwidth" varies by product. On Blackwell GPUs, any mode operating above 1620 MHz is considered high bandwidth. For instance, the 7680x4320@60Hz mode defined in the CTA-861-H specification runs at 2376 MHz, making it a high bandwidth mode for Blackwell.
   * These monitors typically support display scaling natively. However, in some single-monitor setups, users may still prefer GPU scaling. When multiple monitors are connected to a GPU and at least one of them is high bandwidth, that monitor will default to display scaling only. GPU scaling is disabled in this case due to bandwidth limitations. Notably, display scaling can be more efficient than GPU scaling in such scenarios, as it reduces the bandwidth load on display cables—especially at higher refresh rates.
   * When GPU scaling is not enabled for a monitor, only the modes supported by the monitor itself will appear in both the Windows and NVIDIA control panels. Additionally, the "Display scaling" option will be pre-selected in the "Adjust desktop size and position" section of the NVIDIA Control Panel.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*
* **Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**
* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations between hardware and software. Driver will never be perfect and there will always be issues for some people. Two people with the same hardware configuration might not have the same experience with the same driver versions. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad.

Title: Is it worth it to upgrade to a 5070 from a 4060 for 1440p gaming?

Post: I currently have a 4060 8Gb and a i5-14400F, and I just got a new 1440p monitor. Is upgrading to a 5070 for 550 usd worth it for 1440p gaming? I plan on upgrading my cpu, but unless I get another 14 series intel, I would need to change my whole motherboard. So paired up with the current cpu, is getting a 5070 worth it to game at 1440?

Edit: Thank you to everyone that commented, I pulled the trigger and bought it. Also decided to get a new psu that was on sale with it just in case, and for when I upgrade my cpu.

Title: Ok, I give up. Please help me optimize my PC

Post: I recently purchased a Maingear PC after dreaming about owning a high end gaming PC. Specs : Ryzen 7 9800x3d, 32 gb RAM, RTX 5090, 2 TB SSD. I wanted to play all the latest AAA titles on the highest graphical fidelity. I have a Samsung Odyssey G8 240Hz UHD OLED monitor. Every game I play (Cyberpunk , Indiana Jones, Wukong), there's shit ton of Screen Tearing (both VSYNC and GSYNC are on so it is better now), weird outline over the characters (Possibly caused by DLSS and Frame Gen), so much blurriness in the games that something feels off. 

What am I doing wrong ? Why do I need DLSS if my native resolution and render resolution are both 4K ? If I turn off Frame Gen, the frame rate drops to 40s and 50s. What is the point of a 5090 if I cant even play games on their highest setting ? Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong ? Forgive my naivety and noob-ness.

Title: Yes I used technology for this post. A history of the most valuable company on planet earth.

Post: How NVIDIA changed on the hardware level since Kepler/GT 640

(quick timeline of the big hardware shifts)

	•	Kepler (≈2012): energy-efficient jump from Fermi; used for GeForce 600 series (GT 640 era).  ￼
	•	Maxwell (≈2014): big efficiency and geometry changes — better perf/watt for gaming laptops and desktops.  ￼

	•	Pascal (≈2016): much higher perf and new memory/encode options (GDDR5X, better NVENC/NVDEC), widely used in GTX 10-series.  
￼
	•	Volta (≈2017) → Turing (2018): Volta introduced heavy AI features (Tensor Cores) for data-center training; Turing brought RT Cores and Tensor Cores to consumer GPUs (real-time ray tracing + AI-accelerated features).  ￼

	•	Ampere (2020) and Hopper (2022): much larger steps oriented at AI training/inference and data-center scaling (more Tensor/Core performance, faster memory/HBM options).  ￼

	•	Blackwell (2024+): NVIDIA’s latest high-end AI GPU architecture focused on massive generative-AI workloads and efficiency gains vs prior generations.  ￼

Hardware trends since GT-640: much bigger die sizes and core counts, widespread use of Tensor cores (for matrix math / AI), RT cores (ray tracing), migrations to faster memory types (GDDR5 → GDDR6/GDDR6X and HBM variants), new interconnects (NVLink/NVSwitch) and much stronger hardware/software stacks for data-center AI.

How did NVIDIA changed on the company / business level since then?

	•	From mainly graphics to AI &amp; data-center leader: In 2012 NVIDIA was best known as a PC/gaming GPU company. Over the last decade it has shifted a huge portion of its revenue and strategy into data-center AI hardware, software (CUDA/ecosystem), and platforms (DGX, cloud partnerships). By 2024–2025 the Data Center segment became NVIDIA’s dominant revenue driver.  ￼

	•	Acquisitions &amp; strategic moves: NVIDIA bought networking specialist Mellanox (2020) to strengthen data-center networking stacks; it attempted a large acquisition of Arm (announced 2020) but abandoned the deal after regulatory opposition (2022). Those moves show the company’s strategic pivot to cloud/datacenter infrastructure.  ￼

	•	Software &amp; platform expansion: NVIDIA moved from selling GPUs alone to selling a stack — hardware + CUDA + optimized libraries (cuDNN, TensorRT), software platforms, and partner integrations with hyperscalers (AWS/Azure/Google) to enable training/deployment of large AI models. This software focus multiplied the value of their GPUs beyond raw silicon.  ￼

Title: GPU: upgrade 5070TI or 5080 (3440x1440p gaming)

Post: As the title suggest i would like to upgrade my gpu as my rtx 3080 FE is dying, it starts freezing randomly while gaming and sometimes even when browsing like chrome/firefox. ive mined with it for a long time so i guess its finally burned out (i dont mine anymore).

**Current setup:**

**CPU:** ryzen 9800x3d

**GPU:** RTX 3080 FE

**PSU:** 850watt rated gold from corsair

**Monitor:** 34 inch Alienware oled 3440x1440p (165hz)

**Games i like playing are:**

\- World of Warcraft

\- Diablo 4

\- Red dead redemption 2

\- God of War

\- Warhammer space marine 2

\- Cyberpunk  2077

\- other triple AAA games

**Budget:** €1000ish in the Netherlands

**Suggestions ive found are:**

\- RTX 5070 TI Tuf gaming for €850

\- RTX 5070 TI gaming trio OC for €909

\- RTX 5080 Gainward GeForce Phoenix €999

\- RTX 5080 MSI ventus 3x OC for €1069

\- RTX 5080 MSI gaming trio OC for €1279

\- EDIT: found a RTX 5080 founders edition for €1069 so thats an option aswell

The reason i went for some higher end models is not the RGB but more for efficient and sort off silenced cooling, as my current 3080 FE makes alot of noise on load sometimes the sound is even going through my headphones.

what would you guys like suggest for my current monitor and maybe for gaming on my 4k oled tv sometimes? aiming for atleast 60fps

Current monitor im playing on 3440x1440 (21:9 ultrawide)

Thank you in advance!

Title: Zotac rtx 5070 twin edge repaste - Honeywell ptm7950

Post: A bit of context:

So I'm planning to build a sffpc in the Midori 5l v2.4 case and got some parts already. As it is a small case I want all the thermals to be optimal, so I decided to repaste the rtx 5070 I already bought as a precaution.

The proces:

Unscrew the 8 visible screws on the back of the gpu, then unscrew the 2 screws that are connected to the heatsink on the IO shield side.

Apply a bit of force to the shroud/heatsink and the pci and then you will feel it separating from each other and it will look like this(I forgot to take before the cleaning pictures):

https://preview.redd.it/wa0dl2c1an2g1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ccb54f0433fefb0df5dab6e07c5cb8520c7f05

Close up of the die:

https://preview.redd.it/csosdji9an2g1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e02da12790f84c4a78329e5f0f97a93952131b

Then I applied the PTM7950 which I measured by pressing it on the die and then cutting it with some scissors.

I am aware that the top right corner seems a bit off but I think it will be fine as soon as the gpu gets used and heated:

https://preview.redd.it/lxqyy5agan2g1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74519b277e9581198f1f7ea419d034b7f6c8551b

Then just do the whole process backwards and you got a assembled gpu again.

I can't test the unit right now because I don't have all the necessary parts yet but I might make a separate post with thermals and stuff for what it's worth.

Thanks for reading and have a great weekend!

Title: MSI Ventus 2x or Gigabyte Windforce OC 3x - 5070

Post: Hey, so I'm looking to buy a 5070. Right now, the MSI Ventus 2x and Gigabyte Windforce OC 3x are both on discount, but the MSI is about $60 cheaper than the Gigabyte. I've read that the MSI is very loud and tends to run hot, but I've also read that Gigabyte Windforce has some type of leakage of some sort. I'm not an expert on the GPU's, so any help would be greatly appreciated. And if any of you have one of these GPU's, have you ran into any problems?

Title: Can the 5070 Ti support three 1440p 240 hz monitors?

Post: If it can't, what's the maximum refresh rate I could set the monitors to to ensure that all three can be connected to the 5070Ti? Better yet if I could have different ones set to different refresh rates so that the middle one can be 240.

Apologies for the ignorance, it's just hard to find answers with such specific scenarios.

Title: whats the point of GALAX HOF edition??

Post: I was looking 5070 Ti brands for comparison and came across the Galax HOF Edition, that priced cheaper than the Asus TUF and MSI Gaming Trio. I’m curious why is it priced lower? Is there any catch?

I found this short video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TdxfQ968wCA
.If you turn on auto audio translation, the guy mentions that the card is extremely overkill, Galax really went all nuts on the components. He explains that the 5070 Ti HOF uses essentially the same design as the 5080 Ti, including the same number of power phases, VRAM configuration, MOSFETs, and power delivery system.

If the 5070 Ti is somewhat limited with a 300W power cap, I’m wondering why Galax would implement more power phases and overkill components than the card technically requires?

Title: 5070ti or 5080 (1440p &amp; No RT)?

Post: Now that we're relatively sure the Super series will either be cancelled or massively delayed, I'm finding myself in a situation that probably a lot of people find themselves in. With rising RAM prices and the possibility tech will get more expensive over the next couple months and possibly years, I'm looking to build my PC now instead of waiting for a potential release next year. 

I was originally aiming at buying a 5080 super, because 24GB of VRAM would've been an attractive purchase, but when it comes to the regular **5080 vs 5070ti**, it's not quite as obvious to me. The performance difference seems to be somewhat small at **1440p**, especially for somebody like me that is not interested at all in utilizing RT.

I'm in the unique position where **I don't really have a set budget** and wouldn't mind spending extra for a better card, but only if it's a worthwhile purchase in terms of value (I don't like the idea of overspending an extra 300 bucks for a tiny performance increase).

In Germany, the cheaper versions of the 5070ti, like the MSI Ventus 3x OC start around **750€** while the cheaper 5080 Models like the Gigabyte Windforce start around **1050€**, so around a **300€ difference** for me.

I almost exclusively play a variety of Multiplayer games like Arc Raiders, The Finals, Path of Exile 2, Deadlock, Rust, V Rising or League of Legends. I usually never play any super demanding Singleplayer games, but obviously would still like to have the option to in the future. 

Would really appreciate hearing some of your guys' opinions, maybe what decision you personally made and on a sidenote I'd also be interested if you guys think buying more expensive versions of cards (like buying the MSI Gaming Trio 5070ti for about 900€ instead of the MSI Ventus 3x 5070ti for 760€) for better cooling etc. is worth it? **Thanks in advance!**

\_\_\_\_\_

The rest of my planned build is as follows:

**AMD 9950x3D (I also do professional work)**  
**64GB DDR5-6000 CL30**   
**MSI Tomahawk x870**  
**Samsung 990 Pro 4TB**  
**Corsair RM1000x**  
**Arctic Freezer 3 Pro 420mm**  
**HAVN HS420**

\_\_\_\_\_  


*Oh, and I'm aware many people will want to recommend the 9070XT instead, which would most likely be better price to performance than what team green has to offer, but I just don't like how many titles are still missing proper FSR support at launch. Even though it's getting a lot better, I still enjoy the fact that pretty much every game has DLSS support right out of the box, which is why I'm not considering an AMD card* ***just yet****.*

Title: Rtx 5080 installation

Post: Hi everyone,

I just got an MSI GeForce RTX 5080 16G GAMING TRIO OC and I want to make sure I connect it properly to avoid any issues with the power connector.

Here’s my setup:

* PSU: Corsair RM1000X (ATX 3.1)
* Using native PCIe cables from the PSU
* GPU will be installed normally in the case (ASUS ProArt PA602 TG Black)

I have a few basic questions:

1. Anything I should pay special attention to when plugging in the 12VHPWR connector?
2. Are there any precautions to prevent connector overheating or melting?
3. Should I do anything extra to make sure the connector is seated properly and safe during load?

I can understand asking questions regarding settings or issues but all these questions asking which one to get are getting ridiculous. No one knows what you’re looking for in a gpu, but a simple search can explain the differences in performance and features.

Title: RTX 5090 Palit Gamerock UV

Post: I undervolted my RTX 5090 based on the guide from RockOrStone.

I got a better score in Steele Nomad, from 14k to about 14.9k. Yet, the power consumption only went from 575W down to around 530W.

Only with 85% power target, I am around 500W, which gives me around 14.2k in Steel Nomad.

Why I am getting not near any 460W? (except when using 70% power target)

Title: New GPU expectations

Post: Back in early 2018 I built my first gaming PC (Intel). 1080 ti sc, i7 8700k, 48gb of G skill ram, 1000 watt gq gold PSU. I was having a blast and still am actually lol. 1080 ti was/is such a great card. However, its 2025 and its time to upgrade. Of course, this hobby can be pretty pricey lol so I decided to focus on the most expensive hardware first, the GPU. 

I went ahead and ordered a 5070 ti for starters. Ill have it this weekend (hell yeah!). I do plan on upgrading everything else, one step at a time. As such, my question is what can I expect in terms of performance? I know my current CPU, Ram, and even Mobo will be bottlenecks. Mobo is a Asus Rog Strix z370 gaming-f.  PCIE is a 3.0 (i read this wont prevent me from using an RTX card, which was one of the motivations for starting with the GPU first). 

My expectations are a smooth 60fps at most at 4k. This will be my first time seeing what DLSS can do. Based on my current specs, I guess my question is, will I be content until im able to upgrade everything else? Looking to play games like starfield, FFXVI, Dragon's Dogma II, etc. These games may be CPU heavy though. Hoping, playing at a high res will put more load on the GPU (hopefully, not a detrimental amount). 

Also, if anybody wants too, I would be stoked to see any recommendations for an intel based CPU that'll work well with a 5070 ti, mobo, brand/speed of Ram. But yeah, this is what I'm working with.

Title: Help buying PNY RTX 5090 32OC

Post: Hi there,

After about 7 months ago my AMD 7900XTX gave up after using it for 1.5 year. Had also lots driver issues.

So fast forward I decided to buy an PNY 5090 32 oc non rgb... and tomorrow I will pick one up from marketplace. It's "it's like brand new and just used for testing" yeah I will check on that.

My question is is my setup just fine for this card. I was only concerning about the psu of 1000w and what I understand is to use the cables from the psu. So maybe someone has exact same psu and can tell me if my setup is ok.

My pc specs are

Win 11

MSI MAG B850 TOMAHAWK MAX WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard

Deepcool LS520 WH 85.85 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler

AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D

TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL38

Corsair RM1000e (2023) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply

Deepcool CH560 DIGITAL ATX Mid Tower Case

So any help or suggestions are welcome.

Thanks in advance

Title: How does a 5090 compare to a Thor?

Post: I was hoping to find a comparison online but have found relatively few specs for Thor. In terms of GPU performance - can anybody compare a 5090 to a Thor? It seems like the Thor has a lot more RAM, but it's LPDDR5X vs GDDR7 so actual memory bandwidth is way smaller (I think 273GBps vs 1792GBps). Also not clear if all the RAM can be used as VRAM on Thor.

  
What about AI/inference capabilities? I'm having trouble finding any solid specifications for Thor. Thank you!

which one of the following would you recommend? theyre all about the same price here

ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5080 OC

Title: Which model of RTX 5070 Ti should I buy?

Post: Hi, I'm building a new PC and I'm trying to buy an RTX 5070 Ti but I'm a little confused about which model to choose among those most easily available where I live.

I have to admit that I really like the design of the Zotac Solid and it was my first choice (Zotac RTX 5070 Ti Solid SFF that costs at the moment around 790€) but I noticed in a comparison of a well-known review site that even the biggest Amp Extreme are among the worst for noise and temps, just above the MSI Ventus OC.

Is the Zotac Solid so bad?

  
Someone told me to keep an eye on the KFA2 RTX 5070 Ti EX Gamer because it has some top performance in that comparison, but here can be find only at 859€.

Unfortunately there aren't great deals despite the black friday events and the other models that where most available at a reasonable price were gone in few seconds; these models usually are the PNY, the Gigabyte Windforce SFF, the Palit Gaming Pro-S and the Gainward Phoenix-s (I don't know about their performance compared to those previously mentioned), between 780€ and 805€ at the moment. The last two are the cheapest but also the ones I like least aesthetically (I know I shouldn't be too picky but this is my first build after 10 or more years...).

What should I buy in your opinion?

Thanks in advance

Title: From 2070 Super to 5060 TI

Post: Hello fellow redditors,

Wanted your suggestions  for upgrade, planning to go from 2070S to 5060 Ti (16gb). Targetting 60-120 fps on rpg, open world games and mobas. Don't play any competitive shooters.

Does new 5060 Ti make sense or should I look for used 4070/4070 Ti

Since I have upgraded to 7800x3d, if feel there is performance on the table and also how memory prices are increasing, don't want to pay bomb for Graphics card as well in the future.

Have seen reviews on YouTube but some real world experience would help

Title: 5070 ti Black Screen issues - FIXED my issue.. maybe you have the same?

Post: Hello,

So I bought a 5070 ti a few months ago and would frequently, but also randomly get a black screen and my fans would ramp up to 100% causing me to have to restart my computer. I then went to try and fix it and unplugged my gpu and reseated it, etc... then it wouldn't even power on anymore at all.

  
I bought a new power supply today, higher watt and it still wasn't working.. then I held the cord up, and supported it and it booted so I put a piece of cardboard to hold it up and since I've done that (its been 7 days) I haven't had the issue at all. I am of course going to RMA the card, but maybe they added the power socket poorly?

Post: Basically the title. I have a temporary 9060xt with a 9950x3d, 64gb ram, and 1000w psu. The plan was the go with a 5080 super because I thought they might release soon but that’s not looking like the case. My pc is 5080/5090 ready but I just don’t know. The thought of spending 1k+ on a gpu and it not being able to keep up after 4 years is turning me away. It would be nice to play story games in 4k and competitive games in 1440p for at least 6 years. Is this possible with 5080? Been looking at open box gpus on micro center website.

Title: Is the 5070ti overkill?

Post: I’m looking at different prebuilts and wondering if the 5070ti is overkill. I currently have a 1080p 240hz monitor and normally I don’t play graphic heavy games, but sometimes I’ll get months I’ll play high quality Fortnite etc. I’m more leaning towards 5070ti bc of the higher vram, 2 more years of use, and support for creation tasks.
The 5070 prebuilts for the CPU’s I’m looking at are like $200 less but harder to find.

Title: Silent Champions: Finding the Quietest RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti

Post: Hi all,

I’m completing my PC build and my top priority is silence. I don’t care much about raw performance — what really matters is minimal to no  coil whine. The sound of fans blowing is generally fine. I have extremely sensitive hearing, so even small high-pitched noises are disruptive.

I’d love to hear from you all about your experiences:

* Which RTX 5080 or 5070 Ti cards do you currently own?
* How quiet are they under load — both fan noise and any coil whine?
* Did you notice any high-pitched sounds during gaming, benchmarks, or stress tests?

Even small differences matter to me, so any detailed impressions or real-world experiences would be extremely helpful.

Thanks in advance..

Title: Need Help and Advice On New Brig (RTX 5080 Build)

Post: ***EDIT:*** This is the current plan so far. I don't know the Customs charge me money if I bought them via my cousin who's living in UK and have him sent them as personal belongings part by part, but I'll try to do that. Because this system with worse parts costs 2 times more expensive here, even with the November discounts and my government taxes EVERYTHING almost 3 or 5 times more. So Customs may confiscate them and I'd be charged money AND lose the item. So yeah, wish me luck!

***EDIT 1,5:*** I'll buy SSD and monitor locally, I found them cheaper than PcPartsPicker. So they're off the list. SSD bought!

\---

Hey everyone! I need some help from you guys.  
(Admins please don't ban me for my words in spoiler tags, I can delete them if asked/demanded!)

I'm trying to build a new PC because right now I'm totally fed up with my 15 year old base model HP Pro 3500 Microtower.  
I'm planning on building my new brig with a RTX 5080 GPU, so I need pointers and advices on some details. I plan to use this computer for daily use as well as for almost everything else; including 3D design, gaming, video rendering, (possibly) streaming and other projects as a Workstation. So more cores for CPU is sought and probably only a single stick of RAM will be chosen along with Terabytes worth of SDD stick for C drive.

First of all; ***YES***, I *know* we're about to see RTX6000 series coming soon and I'm aware that a RTX 5070 Ti would be cheaper alternative. But I want this new PC to last as long as it can and be open to upgrade with coming decades with best parts I can afford with my limited income. I've been using hand me down systems that are always two or three generations late to the current technology, so that's it for me in my 35th age. I want and am ready to "waste" my whole savings on a high-end pc for the first time now. So please forgive me for my stubborn decisions that I won't change my mind about wanting a 5080. I would even prefer a **"RTX 5080 Founder's Edition"** but it feels like it's impossible to get one in where I'm living. Oh, I'm living in Türkiye, btw, so it would be pretty hard to find anything on MSRP in this &gt;!Hellhole!&lt; at any rate...

Secondly, I absolutely hate RGB lighting and I don't care about how my PC Case looks like from outside. Not trying to be rude or aim to hurt anyone with my words but unfortunately, I'm not a &gt;!monkey with autism!&lt; who sits on the floor to watch the movements of flickering LED-lit fans and RAM Modules instead of using the computer itself. So I want my system with **no RGB at all**. Like at all, ever.  
Also I don't plan on connecting to the internet with Wİ-Fi, it's really really bad in my country. I'll use my cable so I need a **Motherboard specially a** ***without*** **Wi-Fi connection feature and RGB lighting**. I don't need it and it seems like those are more expensive anyway.

Third, I'm not planning to buy new keyboard, mouse or monitor for now. Even though I'd like to have an OLED monitor like every other PC user, I can't afford it *yet*. For now I'm happy with my Fujitsu LT22T-2 (monitor), white-backlit Logitech G413 SE with several burnt LEDs (Keyboard) and SteelSeries Rival 110 (Mouse) which my friend threw in garbage bin years ago. Even though the HDMI to VGA connection would totally degrade my display performance. I need to accumulate more funds for a new one. *Preferably a one with built-in speakers.*

Last of all, list of what I'm planning to buy and where I need advices most:

* I'll probably go for **ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5080**, even though I wanted a *Founder's Edition*
* **AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D** for CPU because obvious reasons
* **Kingston FURY Renegade 32 GB DDR5-7200 CL38** (2 x 16 GB) would be for RAM. Might get a **Klevv BOLT V 32 GB DDR5-7200 CL34** (2 x 16 GB) if I cant.
* For PSU, **be quiet! Pure Power 13 M 1000 W 80+ (Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX)** might be good (totally according to PcPartsPicker). I'll be connecting my 4TB Western Digital Gold Harddisk along with my current 2,5inch SSD for "spare" capacity too, so I hope I'll be alright.
* **~~WD BLACK 4TB SN850X Gen4 NVMe 2280 M.2 SSD (7300MB read/6300MB write)~~** ~~for main SSD.~~ ✔
* **Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 Black 66.17 CFM** is chosen for CPU Cooler as per advices.
* Do I still need a **(water) cooling system on the GPU?**
* I think I'll pick **Samsung Odyssey G65B 32.0"** for monitor. It's 2560 x 1440 resolution, is 240Hz and Curved.
* With recent advices, I chose **Asus TUF GAMING X870-PLUS WIFI** for Motherboard
* System will be Free Dos, of course... But I'll keep using my Windows 10, still not trusting W11 yet.

If you think there are other OEM parts missing, I would be very grateful if you could also suggest additions.

\---

**TL;DR:** Will the things written in **bold letters** work together and is there anything I'm missing for a new rig? Yes I know 5070 Ti would be a cheaper alternative but I want to keep up with new technology already and play games in 2K and so on...

Title: Considering upgrading from rtx 4070 to a rtx 5070 Ti

Post: Found a MSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16G VENTUS 3X OC to a reasonable price (in my country atleast(\~700€)).

I play all games in 1440p (given its possible) and my 4070 handles it well.

The upgrade is more of a "future-proofing"-investment, because of the whole RAM-stuff thats going on (also the speculation regarding the super-series).

So, would it be a good idea to upgrade for this reason or just hold out for next gen?

And if upgrading now, is the MSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16G VENTUS 3X OC a good choice or should i look for a different one?

A 5080 wouldn't be off the table, but when I only play 1440p i'm thinking its very much overkill.

Title: Time for me to join. 5070ti or 5080?

Post: Alright everyone. I've seen many other people asking, and it's my turn to do the ask now. 

Currently, I have an EVGA FTW3 3080Ti, and the card does pretty much everything I need with a few slight hiccups. I was running a 1440 monitor, until I recently dropped, and cracked the shit out of it, and have yet to replace it, so ive been using 1080p for now. My plan is to get, at minimum, another 1440p when getting the card, if not just bumping to 4k.

Examples of hiccups: BL4 tearing in graphics but crashes when I try to fix and tweak settings (apparently its just a BL4 thing though), tearing occasionally in CoD (once every like 10 games or so), even League of Legends has had hiccups where the game just shit the bed, while my card is just loaded from it (200 year experience spaghetti code at its finest (ifykyk)). Biggest issue is that one of the display ports has NEVER worked on the card, and will cause my screen to flicker when a monitor is plugged into it. Not a big deal though as there's plenty to over look it, just kind of a pain that I bought the card in covid time 2022 when you couldn't find any.

Based on user benchmark, the 5080 provides approx 60% effective speed, 105% OC score, whereas the 5070ti is 38/71% respectively. So my question is this: Which is the more effective, and personal recommended user upgrade in my situation?

5080 in consideration: NewEgg - [5080 Suprim Liquid](https://www.newegg.com/msi-rtx-5080-16g-suprim-liquid-soc-geforce-rtx-5080-16gb-graphics-card/p/N82E16814137905?tpk=1&amp;item=N82E16814137905)

5070ti in consideration: undecided as i haven't shopped them enough.

Other specs: 32g (2x16g) corsair vengeance lpx ddr4 ram
MPG z740 gaming edge wifi mobo
i9-10850k CPU
2 1TB SSD WD blue cards for storage
one 1080p Asus monitor(primary for now as previously stated) one 720p Dell monitor (only used for internet browsing/talking in discord while gaming)
Corsair RM850x 80 PLUS Gold
I dont know my case model/size as it came with my original build which was an IBP BB930 pre-made model

P.S. Roast the build if you want. I'm pleased with it. And that's what matters.

Title: Best card for VR in the 500/600 range

Post: Hey there -

So I'd like to start experimenting with some VR gaming. The PSVR2 is on sale, and the announcement the other week of the steam frame has kind of peaked my interest. I currently have an Arc 770 which I've actually been pretty happy with all and all, but Intel really isn't interested in drivers/support for VR. I did a bit of googling to old reddit posts, and things/prices move so fast it's hard to get a good gauge on what to get. I don't have an unlimited budget, more of a 'this is my one thing for christmas' kinda thing, so somewhere in the 500 to 600 range. Any rec's for good cards in that price range through the lens of really wanting to experiment with some VR stuff? The idea of doing some Skyrim or some space ims in VR seems super cool.

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700KF CPU @ 3.60GHz (3.60 GHz)

Title: RTX 5070 Ti with RTX 2000 Ada as Physx / transcode

Post: I got my hands on a 2000 Ada gpu. 

I recently built a mATX setup - Aorus B850m , so i got a second pcie slot to play with. i used a pcie extension to connect to 2000 Ada.

  
I thought this was a simple plug and play

but looks like Win 11 shows an exclamation mark on the 2000 Ada gpu in device manager

so i uninstalled all drivers, clean. and installed 5070 Ti game ready drivers -

after some time  monitor goes black and the nvidia shortcut and taskbar icon vanishes.

the monitor is connected to the 5070Ti via DP

for some reason my 5070Ti gets the exclamation mark and my monitor goes black and then the Ada 2000 is running ( yes the monitor is still on the 5070 Ti ) 

Nvidia app now shows a totally new set of studio drivers drop down in the drivers tab. no option for the game ready drivers.

I am unable to figure out this glitch.

is there a way to make my 5070ti primary gpu? and any means to use the GRdrivers to also recognize 2000 ? 

should I have to use Nvcleaninstall and choose 2000 ada to be add manually? or any known firmware version of GRD that works for both 5070 Ti and 2000 Ada ?

Or some BIOS tweak needed on my gigabyte b850m?

so close yet cant run the second gpu

This guy ( deleted ) somehow managed to get it running 9 months ago. [https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iznan4/rtx\_5090\_with\_rtx\_a2000\_for\_physx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1iznan4/rtx_5090_with_rtx_a2000_for_physx/)

# READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes, hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, **please read and try the following before making a post** — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order, if a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.

* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth check your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.
* If you have any power related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.
* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.
* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers or buttons you can use, please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.
* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.
* Make your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual as the BIOS flashback procedure will very depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.
* If you are using an AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, RX 9000 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30, RTX 40 or RTX 50 GPU, please ensure you are using separate 6 - 8pin PCIe cables or dedicated 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 cables and not using daisy-chained or splitter cables, as these may not be able to supply adequate power to the GPU — some cards may have LED indicators by the connector to let you know if the GPU isn't receiving enough power. Please consult your GPU and PSU manual for information on how to correctly connect your GPU.
* Make sure your Monitor or TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor or TV and if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters or splitters, remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.
* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games and applications.
* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs and other performance, security, stability and compatibility issues.
* Make sure you are running the latest [AMD Chipset or Graphics Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.
* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using the [AMD Cleanup Utility](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/GPU-601.html) or [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers, a guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)
* If you have installed GPU drivers after using the AMD Cleanup Utility or DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.
* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)) please [view the following thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1hdjxba/guide_how_to_resolve_windows_update_installing/) on the steps you can take to resolve and prevent this happening in future.
* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/).
* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using.
* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.
* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values, this can be checked under Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Power Options.
* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features and improve compatibility and interoperability.
* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner or Ryzen Master, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities as well.
* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them, a guide is available here
* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.
* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) — [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) — [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) — [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) — [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) — [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) — You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate wattage.
* Try and apply common sense to an issue, for example if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, DIMM slot on the motherboard or pins, have you tried reseating it etc...
* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdown or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.

Title: I finished my first AMD rig since my Athlon XP 2100+ in 2002. Cat tax included! Also retired my GOAT evga 1080ti hybrid FTW3 in Sept with a Powercolor 9070XT, my first/last AMD/Ati gpu was a 9800 Pro for Half Life 2 launch.

Post: My faithful GOAT evga 1080ti hybrid FTW3 for over 6 years was retired a few months ago due to concerns of the pump failing and I decided I no longer wanted to support Ngreedia after 20 years of using them, as well as ditching Asus and Intel that I've also been using the last 20+ years. It feels really good to be back on team red as my very first computer I ever built was a AMD Athlon Axia 1.33Ghz on a Socket A Abit-KT7A waaaaay back in spring of 2001. At that time I went all out and got the first of its kind, VisionTek GeForce 3 for it. Flash forward to 2004 and Values STEAM and Half Life 2 had launched and benchmarks on the web showed that ATIs GPUs ran it much better then the shitty GeForce FX series which also ran hot and loud. So I ditched my geforce got my first ATi Hercules 9800 Pro AGP, it was quite a change back then, but not as much as going from 20 years of geforce usage to AMD with thid beautiful powercolor 9070 XT! It's really nice having the CPU/motherboard/gpu driver and software all together. Adrenaline is super easy to use vs that horrid geforce experience crap and the old nvidia control panel is just so out of date. Going from my i7 9700k to this 9800xd is a amazing difference, I cannot believe how much my 9700k was holding back this 9070xt in games! Cyberpunk went up nearly 50fps! I don't think I'll ever use anything else other AMD products. Feels good to be back in RED camp after all this time!

Title: AMD drivers performing hundreds of SSD writes every time you move or resize a window - proof and workaround included.

Post: It has been noticed and posted [multiple](https://techestigate.com/amd-ati-drivers-filling-up-space-on-system-disk-in-eeudumps-folder/) [times](https://github.com/GSDragoon/RadeonSoftwareSlimmer/discussions/140) by [different](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1brnh5c/constant_writes_to_windowssystem32amdeeudumps/) [people](https://pc-help.cnews.cz/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=226514), that AMD's drivers constantly writes to logfiles in `C:\Windows\System32\AMD\EEUDumps\`. Yesterday I found out, just how bad it really is. I have recorded a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw1yN0eq5zw

In the video, I have a program running that records every change to the hard drive (using [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-readdirectorychangesw))
Every new line in the console window is a modification of the file. Notice how they completely stop when I disable the "AMD External Events Utility" service. 

Every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.

The writes seem to be caused by the service "AMD External Events Utility", disabling it immediately stops the writes. Apparently this service handles things like [FreeSync](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/8bvcfo/do_not_disable_amd_external_events_utility/) which has been confirmed by an AMD engineer.

There might be other oocasions, where the files are written to, but these are the most egregious situations I could find.

Nowadays, of course, most people will use SSDs, especially for their system drives. SSDs have a limited amount of bytes written before they inevitably degrade and die. Now just think about how much lifespan AMD takes of SSDs globally doing this. In my research I found that this has been an ongoing issue for multiple years.

Fun fact: I run an NVIDIA graphics card, but an AMD processor, and the chipset drivers apparently also include this service.

Testing for yourself: I've created a simple tool to watch for writes to that Folder. You can download it from my [GitHub](https://github.com/tGecko/AMD-EeuDumps)  
I have kept the code simple and GitHub compiles it automatically, so it's guaranteed that the .exe represents the code in `AMD-EeuDumps.c` and can easily be verified. Your Browser and Windows will probably complain about the file, simply because it's an unknown .exe. Alternatively, compile the exe yourself from the source code using `cl.exe /O2 /Fe:AMD-EeuDumps.exe AMD-EeuDumps.c`

Workaround: I applied [this](https://github.com/GSDragoon/RadeonSoftwareSlimmer/discussions/140#discussion-7792873) workaround, redirecting writes to the whole folder to nul: so they never touch the disk. It seems to be working fine for me, but apply it at your own risk.

EDIT: Had a mistake in this post, changed the path to the correct one `C:\Windows\System32\AMD\EEUDumps\`

EDIT 2: My relevant specs:  
Asus TUF Gaming B650-E Wifi  
AMD 7800X3D  
NVIDIA 4070 Super  
AMD Chipset software 7.06.02.123

Title: Burnt Connector - Sapphire Nitro+ 9070XT Question

Post: Hey everyone,

I recently bought a new GPU about a month or two ago, and I’m concerned about a burnt connector on my PC. I tested it today, and it still turns on and works, but when I try to load games like Battlefield Six, my screen goes black, and I have to reboot my PC for it to work again. The GPU still turns on and works, but the connector is burnt. I’m not sure what to do. Is the GPU still safe? Should I get a new cable, or is my GPU damaged?

The card turns on and works, but when I play games or surf the web, the screen randomly goes black while the PC is still on, and then I have to hard shut it down.

This GPU was never modified or overclocked. I always played with an undervolt set for the GPU, and it never exceeded the 600W limit of the wire. Only plaid games like Battlefield 6, Cyberpunk 2077, Outerworlds, Minecraft, etc.

**Edit #1**: For the people asking me why I bought the 12V 9070 XT, it was because I got it as a gift from a friend. I was going to buy a 5070 Ti w/o the 12V connector, but I got the Nitro+ for free, so I used it. I contacted Sapphire for RMA, and they are currently asking for the purchase receipt and working it out. I will update it once I hear back with more info

Title: Cutting off support for the entire 6000 series is like putting a horse down because they've started to get a smidge slower on their lap times

Post: It doesn't make sense to take cards that are STILL MORE THAN CAPABBLE in rasterization, and can handle small RT use perfectly fine (extremely heavy RT use cripples them, but only about 20% of games even USE RT in any capacity yet), it has FSR 3.1, it has frame gen, why the hell are you taking it out back to put it down?  The generation in question is hardly even five years old, the 6900XT specifically not launching till December 8th of 2020

This is unfair and goes completely against the norms as to hardware support, I am willing to bet that had you told every single person before purchasing any RX 6000 series product that it would be "cut from life support in less than 5 years from purchase" then I'm willing to bet you would have had a FRACTION the sales count

This is shady, scummy, unfair, and not acceptable, Nvidia supported their GTX 1000 series for NINE YEARS, they supported the GTX 900 series for ELEVEN

What are you doing cutting life support after five years, for some, maybe even most people, that cut off came in an even shorter window, if you bought an RX 6000 series in 2023 then I guarantee you WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED SAID CARD knowing its "life span" would be over in TWO YEARS TIME

\-edit-

For clarification, here is what I am specifically talking about

no more day-1 game profiles, no AFMF 3, no Work Graphs API, all features that boost 1% lows and frame pacing in newer titles.  
Even if the 6000 series can't support certain features, that is no reason to completely cut future game support going forward  
(there should be NO fundamental hardware limitations preventing AMD from enabling AFMF 3 or Work Graphs API on the Radeon RX 6000 series. The blocks are likely software/policy decisions in the Adrenalin driver rather than limitations of the "tech", RDNA 2 async compute matches or exceeds RDNA 3 in throughput, Identical DCN 3.0 as RX 7000, Same ALU + tensor-like ops via driver, RX 6000 uses THE SAME compiler pipeline as RX 9000)

This is "kneecapping" the LARGEST INSTALL BASE OF AMD GPU'S, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say "that's, like, not okay"

Title: I built my first AMD pc after two decades of using Intel.

Post: I bought first AMD product back in 2013, it was a HD7750 OC (New seal) and I was playing Metro 2033 that time. It crashed a lot (BSOD), and I had to underclock the GPU to make it more stable, but in the end still crash and had to switch to an NVIDIA GT630 while promising I’ll never go AMD again (not only I couldn’t overclock the GPU but also had to underclock it)

Now in 2025, Intel performance fell badly, (Oct 5, 2025) I switched back to AMD again. Man it looks like I made the right choice, it’s soooooo much better than Intel for gaming purpose, I also do video editting and heavy multitasking but it’s still good.

Can’t wait for AMD GPU to catch up with Nvidia GPU so I can go full AMD (unlikely to happen lol but at least it’s getting closer and make sense enough to buy AMD gpu)

Here is my new build specs: (Build date Oct 5, 2025)
- Main: X870E Aorus Pro Ice
- CPU: Ryzen 7 9800X3D (PBO -30, +200MHz)
- Memory: 96G (2x48G) Corsair Dominator Titanium White 6600 CL32 (Running @ 6400 CL30)
- GPU: Colorful iGame RTX 5070Ti Ultra White
- PSU: Super Flower Leadex VII Platinum 1000W
- Storage: WD Black SN850X 1TB, WD Black 4TB HDD, Samsung EVO 850 1TB
- Cooler: Thermalright Grand Vision 360 ARGB White
- Case: NZXT H9 Flow White
- Case Fans: 7x Phanteks M25 Gen 2 White (6x reversed)
- Vertical GPU: Cooler Master V3 Pcie 4.0

It was quite a journey to build this PC, the thing is I didn’t buy those parts brand new from the same store :D 
- I bought each part second-hand from different people in different places, I picked parts based on the condition (must comes with box, used looks clean and new,..)
- After assembling everything, I run many tests with RAM (TM5 + Anta777,…), CPU (Cinebench,…), GPU (FFXV Bench,…), paying attention to thermal during idle or under stress,…
- In the end, the computer is fully stable, gaming for a month with no problem. 

P/s: I put the Frieren on the GPU to hide the 600W power cable

# READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING — READ BEFORE POSTING

If you are experiencing any issues, including, but not limited to; games or programs crashing, system crashes or hangs, blue screens of death (BSoD), driver timeouts, system not starting, system freezes, data corruption, system shutting down unexpectedly, visual artifacts, lower than expected performance or any other issue, **please read and try the following before making a post** — the majority of problems can be resolved by trying the steps listed below.

The suggestions below are not necessarily in any particular order. If a step has already been performed or is not relevant, please move to the next step.

* If your system won't power on, make sure all cables are plugged in and seated correctly, that the power supply is plugged into a working wall outlet, and any switches on the wall outlet and/or power supply are in the ON position. It's also worth checking your front panel connectors to make sure they are connected properly and trying a different wall outlet.

* If you have any power-related issues, like your system not starting, shutting down, sleeping, restarting, or waking from sleep, try to test with another power supply, as unstable voltages (such as on the 12V, 5V, 5VSB, and 3.3V rails) can cause a myriad of issues that can be inconsistent and hard to diagnose.

* Make sure your memory modules (RAM) are installed in the primary DIMM slots, as some motherboards will not POST (Power-on self-test) if the memory is installed in the secondary DIMM slots. The primary DIMM slots should be labelled on the motherboard or specified in the motherboard manual.

* If your system does power on, but won't get past the POST screen, please ensure your CPU, RAM, and GPU are installed correctly and try clearing the CMOS. This can usually be done by disconnecting the motherboard from power and removing the CMOS battery for a few minutes. Some motherboards may also have clear CMOS reset jumpers/buttons you can use; please consult your motherboard or system manual on how to clear the CMOS.

* If your system still won't POST, check if your motherboard has a Debug LED and consult your motherboard manual to check what step it's stuck on.

* Make sure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU you have — most AM4 and AM5 motherboards should have BIOS flashback, which will allow you to update the BIOS without needing a CPU or RAM installed. Consult your motherboard manual, as the BIOS flashback procedure will vary depending on the make and model. When using BIOS flashback, we recommend using a USB 2.0 drive that is 8GB or less and formatted as FAT32, as some implementations of BIOS flashback don't work reliably with USB 3.0 drives and/or USB drives that are larger than 8GB.

* Make sure your Monitor/TV is plugged into the HDMI or DisplayPort output from your graphics card and not the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, try a different Monitor/TV if you are using any HDMI or DisplayPort adapters, converters, or splitters. Remove these and use a direct connection, try switching between HDMI and DisplayPort, and try different HDMI or DisplayPort cables to rule out any problems here. For best results, always use certified HDMI or DisplayPort cables.

* Make sure you are running the latest software updates for your operating system, games, and applications.

* Scan your PC for any viruses or malware using Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender) or other reputable Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware solution, as malware, viruses, adware, and other unwanted software can cause crashes, freezes, hangs, and other performance, security, stability, and compatibility issues.

* Make sure you are running the latest [Intel drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html). Some devices, such as laptops and handhelds, may have custom hardware IDs or other manufacturer changes, in which case, you may have to download drivers from the device manufacturer's support page.

* If you need to reinstall GPU drivers, we recommend using  [Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/display-driver-uninstaller-DDU-) to perform a clean installation of the GPU drivers. A guide on how to use DDU can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRRx_3r8GgCpBAMuhT9n5kK6Zse_DYKWvjsW0rLcYQ0/edit)

* If you have installed GPU drivers after using DDU, you may experience stutter in some games while the shaders are cached again.
* If Windows Update is replacing your GPU drivers (example of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/DLLMZ3L)), please [view the following](https://drive.proton.me/urls/QHH65SVJ9M#Q25EPyELVdrT) on the steps you can take to prevent this from happening.

* If you are on Windows 10 or Windows 11 and experience flickering, stuttering, or brightness issues during gaming or video playback with hardware acceleration enabled, try disabling Multiplane Overlay (MPO), as some users have reported this has resolved their issues — more information on disabling MPO is available in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/yvyqc7/disabling_multiplane_overlay_mpo_fixed_all/).

* If a game is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly or having other issues, please verify and repair the game files through [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB), [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicGamesStore/c-EpicGamesStore_LauncherSupport/how-do-i-verify-game-files-in-the-epic-games-launcher-a000084923#:~:text=Find%20the%20game%20in%20your,Click%20the%20Verify%20button), [Ubisoft Connect](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/connectivity-and-performance/article/verifying-game-files-in-ubisoft-connect-pc/000060529), [EA App](https://answers.ea.com/t5/EA-Services-General-Questions/How-to-verify-game-files-of-installed-games/m-p/6578960), [GOG Galaxy](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003930017-My-game-data-is-corrupt-How-can-I-repair-my-game), [Battle.net](https://battle.net/support/article/7655) or whichever game client you are using.

* If a program is crashing, freezing, not starting, performing poorly, or having other issues, please reinstall the program or attempt to repair the installation using the program installer/uninstaller.

* If you are on Windows and are experiencing stuttering or lower than expected performance, make sure you are using the Balanced or High Performance power plan and restore them to their default values. This can be checked under Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Power Options.

* Make sure you are using the latest BIOS, Firmware, and Drivers for your motherboard, laptop, desktop, and any other components and peripherals you have connected to your system. These updates often contain bug fixes, new features, and improve compatibility and interoperability.

* If you have any overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves or similar: **revert everything to stock clocks, timings, voltages and settings**, this includes disabling XMP/EXPO/DOCP — to do this, go into your BIOS and restore the factory settings — this is typically labelled 'Restore Default', 'Restore Optimized Defaults', 'Load Optimized Defaults' or some similar variation. If you are using other utilities like MSI Afterburner, you may also have to restore default settings in those utilities.

* If you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11, use the built-in System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) commands to check for any corrupt or missing operating system files and attempt to repair them. A guide is available here

* If you have a custom built PC, recently upgraded, started overclocking or want to know if your current PSU will support a hardware upgrade, please use one of the *below PSU calculators* and make sure the PSU you have (or intend to buy) can supply enough power when your system is under full load — If your PSU isn't able to supply enough power, you are likely to have issues starting your system and may experience system shutdown when under load.

* PSU Calculators: [FSP](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/landing/calculator.html) — [OuterVision](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) — [Cooler Master](https://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/) — [Seasonic](https://seasonic.com/wattage-calculator) — [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/) — [be quiet!](https://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator) — [MSI](https://www.msi.com/power-supply-calculator) — You can also add all your components into [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) and it will provide an estimate of wattage.

* Try to apply common sense to an issue, for example, if you have flickering on your TV or Monitor, try simple things like changing the HDMI or DisplayPort cable and port on the GPU and display you are using. If you've recently installed a mod and that game now crashes, uninstall that mod. If one of your memory modules is no longer being detected, is there any physical damage to the memory module, the DIMM slot on the motherboard, or the pins? Have you tried reseating it, etc...

* If you experience crashes, freezes, unexpected shutdowns, or just want to check if your system is stable, you can stability test your system with the utilities linked below. Remember that **just because your system turns on, doesn't make it stable** and that overclocking is not guaranteed and can vary depending on the setup you have and the silicon lottery of your CPU/GPU/RAM, you should always thoroughly stability test your system — many reading this post will have unstable systems and won't even know it.

[OCCT](https://www.ocbase.com/occt/personal) — OCCT is the only comprehensive stability testing software available. 20 years of experience have proved OCCT to be the community's software of choice in terms of stability and performance testing. CPU, GPU, Memory, VRAM, and Power supplies are tested in the most efficient and accurate way possible. If there's anything wrong, we'll find it and report it. OCCT includes many advanced features, ranging from per-core CPU testing to varying GPU loads, and much more.

[Prime95](https://www.mersenne.org/download/) — Prime95 has been a popular choice for stress/torture testing a CPU since its introduction, especially with overclockers and system builders. Since the software makes heavy use of the processor's integer and floating point instructions, it feeds the processor a consistent and verifiable workload to test the stability of the CPU and the L1/L2/L3 processor cache. Additionally, it uses all of the cores of a multi-CPU / multi-core system to ensure a high-load stress test environment.

[AIDA64 Extreme](https://www.aida64.com/downloads/latesta64xe) — AIDA64 Extreme is an industry-leading system information tool, loved by PC enthusiasts around the world, which not only provides extremely detailed information about both hardware and installed software, but also helps users diagnose issues and offers benchmarks to measure the performance of the computer.

[Furmark 2](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/downloads/) — FurMark 2 is the successor of the venerable FurMark 1 and is a very intensive GPU stress test on Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) platforms. It's also a quick OpenGL and Vulkan graphics benchmark with online scores. FurMark 2 has an improved command line support and is built with GeeXLab.

[MSI Kombustor](https://geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/downloads/) — MSI Kombustor is MSI's exclusive burn-in benchmarking tool based on the well-known FurMark software. This program is specifically designed to push your graphics card to the limits to test stability and thermal performance. Kombustor supports cutting-edge 3D APIs such as OpenGL or Vulkan.

[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm) — MemTest86 boots from a USB flash drive and tests the RAM in your computer for faults using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns. Bad RAM is one of the most frustrating computer problems to have, as symptoms are often random and hard to pin down. MemTest86 can help diagnose faulty RAM (or rule it out as a cause of system instability). As such it is often used by system builders, PC repair stores, overclockers &amp; PC manufacturers.

[MemTest86+](https://memtest.org/) — Memtest86+ is a stand-alone memory tester for x86 and x86-64 architecture computers. It provides a more thorough memory check than that provided by BIOS memory tests. Memtest86+ can be loaded and run either directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate bootloader that supports the Linux 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, or EFI handover boot protocol. It should work on any Pentium-class or later 32-bit or 64-bit x86 CPU.

[SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/) — Quickly determine the condition of the drive in your computer with this comprehensive, easy-to-use diagnostic.

For more advanced SSD and HDD diagnostic utilities, please check the website of your SSD or HDD manufacturer, as they usually offer manufacturer-specific software to check the health of he drive, test the drive and update firmware, some examples include [Samsung Magician](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/magician/), [Western Digital Dashboard](https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/31759/~/download%2C-install%2C-test-drive-and-update-firmware-using-western-digital) and the [Crucial Storage Executive](https://www.crucial.com/support/storage-executive).

Some motherboards, laptops, and desktops may also have built-in BIOS diagnostic utilities to stress test certain components or the entire system. Please consult your motherboard or system manual for more information.

A truly stable system should be able to run any of these utilities or built-in diagnostics without any crashes, freezes, errors, or other issues.

These utilities can help you narrow down which component(s) in your system are faulty, aren't installed correctly, or have unstable overclocks, underclocks, overvolts, undervolts, custom power curves, etc...

If you require help using any of these programs, please read the help sections on each website or use Google and YouTube, as there are a plethora of guides and tutorials available.

If you have tried all of the above and are still facing the same issue, please **backup any important files/data** and perform a reinstall/clean install of Windows, using a USB or DVD.

**Only use Windows ISO images that come directly from Microsoft.**

The latest Windows 10 and Windows 11 ISO images can be downloaded from the Microsoft [Software Download](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/) page, and you can create a bootable USB or DVD by using the Media Creation Tool.

It's not recommended to use utilities or programs that modify Windows or to use 3rd party, custom, or slimmed Windows ISO images, as these are non-standard ISO images, they could have viruses, malware, and may cause stability and compatibility issues.

If you have done all the above steps and are still facing an issue, please follow the template below for submitting a request. The more detail you can include, the better. **If you post something like 'pc crashes', don't list your PC specifications, what you've tried to resolve the issue or don't provide any helpful information, then don't expect a response, as there's not enough useful information to go on and it will be assumed you haven't read this post or tried any of the steps outlined above.**

*Below is an example template you could use...*

**Summary of the issue**: Playing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 results in unexpected system crashes with no error messages, forcing me to manually restart the computer using the power button.

**What I have tried to resolve the issue**:  Performed comprehensive troubleshooting, including DDU-based reinstallation of driver 32.0.101.6989, BIOS update, extended hardware stress testing (10+ hours), Steam integrity verification, and system log analysis.

Title: I froze Intel’s Arc B580 to 3350 MHz. It loved it.

Post: So, I took a Maxsun B580 iCraft and ran it like it owed me money. Using a 3D printed mount for an LGA1156 CPU water block, I ran automotive coolant through it sitting at around –15C, and pushed voltage from 25mV all the way up to 70 mV. Anything past 60 bounced it off the power limit, but 50–55 was the sweet spot, clean scaling, no throttling, no driver tantrums. Power limit stayed maxed at 120 and core +300. It took me a long time to dial it in, but once I did she was one happy Arc.

Stock clock is 2850 MHz. Under ice it held 3316 MHz sustained, +466 on the core. That's a 16% uplift! While load temps hovered around 20C. It actually set the top 4 graphics score for the B580 on Time Spy, and top overall. Briefly hitting 3350 MHz during the run.

Then the coolant started warming up before I could even start the game runs, it takes 48 hours to re-chill, and by the time I hit Forza, the loop was half slush, half soup.

It still pulled 16 percent average uplift in games, matching the 16 percent clock uplift.

Cyberpunk 107 - 120

Forza 5 158 - 174

MHW 60 - 69

This was all on a stock card, no BIOS or any Voltage mods.

After the initial 1.5 hours of tuning it took me to get there, the card never freaked out, no crashes or black screens... just quiet, consistent scaling. (Unlike Nvidia, Intel doesn't just crash the driver, the whole system restarts... annoying) I didn’t expect Intel Arc to like the cold this much, especially after my last discovery with AMD.

I think there’s still headroom left, contact wasn’t perfect, and the coolant was becoming a warm bath mid run. I will definitely have to give this thing another go... maybe in transmission fluid next time.

There is a video if you want to see the excitement. [https://youtu.be/g9EUn-g8RBU](https://youtu.be/g9EUn-g8RBU)

Title: Panther Lake Breakdown (Intel Core Ultra Series 3)

Post: **UPDATED Note: image is downscaled; full updated image (10200 x 5600) can be found on the Google Drive:**

[**https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hpuD2img4tpE1ABVfIDJlVISLdjlDAki**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hpuD2img4tpE1ABVfIDJlVISLdjlDAki)

**This is my breakdown of intel's Core Ultra Series 3 (codenamed Panther Lake) architecture** which I haven't seen anyone do yet.

All information is sourced from Intel's presentation but much is assumed from past designs (lunar/arrow)

No annotation ver. on second slide.

**edit**: I made these by taking the highest resolution tile layouts available by combining several slides from Intel's presentation. you can see on the second slide where i've replaced areas with my poor photoshop :)

*also, i realised after that X downscales as well sorry.... the post is below anyways.*

Title: How's the current sentiment at Intel like?

Post: I'm almost afraid to say it, but IFS moment might have arrived. Everything seems to be aligning.  

It's been a few years of pain with layoffs (sorry if anyone was let go), capex cuts and tech underperformance. But most pain seems to be behind and Lip-Bu Tan is steering the firm in the right direction. 

1. The Nvidia announcement was big and it was a first step to change the sentiment about the company 
2. Trump admin is laser-focused on strengthening US manufacturing, especially in critical sectors like semiconductors. Having their backing is key 
3. Last week's news about Intel solving 18A yield issues looks very promising.

Curious to know what other people or current employees think.

Title: Xe media and display engine now sits in compute tile?

Post: Credits to Techpowerup for full HD slides

This is quite surprising as previously it sits on SoC tile (Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake) 
but also hardly surprising as this is pretty much Lunar Lake layout, which the media engine also has access to 6MB side cache. 

If this compute tile is inherited by Nova Lake, this begs the question if we will get real F SKU, as in no IGP but still has display and media acceleration. Lost 1 media engine though, like Lunar Lake. I'm curious with that Sony codec though, is the userbase that high to license it from Sony?

Title: Arrow Lake mobile U series | core ultra 265U (E+LPE micro-architecture and design)

Post: Trying to get a sense of the improvement jump if intel doubled (2MB meteor to 4MB arrow) the L2 cache on their LPE cores, which are used in Arrow Lake U series mobile.

From the youtube video below, the SOC tile houses the LPE-cores which splits it from the ring of the compute tile that saves energy as long as the application isn't a compute or resource heavy one.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6wUk44HtO8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6wUk44HtO8)

Q1 - the SOC tile is still coming from TSMC or from Intel Foundry in Arrowlake mobile?  
  
Q2 - Are the E-Core and LPE using the exact Skymont micro-architecture found on Arrowlake desktop?  
  
Q3 - Per E-Core (4x E-Core forms 1 cluster and sharing 4MB L2 in Skymont), does LPE cores have the same L1D$,L1I$ and 4MB L2 as well when configured in just a pair.

My core ultra 155H (meteor-lake), core 20-21 are the LPE cores.   
That pair shares a 2MB L2.

Title: After 9 months, how much has the b580 improved now?

Post: So, even though great card, the arc b580 had a lot of overhead and some driver issues on release. I mean the price had skyrocketed as well but every card was above its msrp anyways. So how much of the problems would you say have been solved since release I really do wanna buy the card.

Title: Found this Intel Extreme Edition 980 Engineering Sample, Anyone have information on it?

Post: The only text on the CPU itself was written in sharpie, just the model number and clock speed, 4 GHz. I can't find any information about it online at all. Hoping someone knows something.

Title: Asus Intel APO Driver Released - Includes more games than Intel has officially listed

Post: A few days ago Asus updated their DTT (APO) driver on their motherboards support page for Z890. Oddly enough Asus is the only board maker that has published the new version of Intel Dynamic Tuning Tech/APO driver as of this posting.

Intel DTT-9.0.11911.64898 (IPF driver V2.2.10204.8) for Windows 10/11 64-bit is latest updated version which includes the new game profiles. Many of which are not Arrow Lake supported unless you enable Advanced Mode, so likely have no performance chance for ARL. But Alder Lake and Raptor Lake might get a nice bump in these new games.

The new driver includes more games than Intel has listed on the official games list located here. [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000098266/processors.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000098266/processors.html)

Additional games include: 

PUBG

Assassin's Creed Valhalla

Diablo IV

Far Cry 6

Forza Horizon 5

Gears 5
